        "claim": "\u201cDetroit actually has the lowest infection rate in the state of Michigan. We\u2019re half of that of the surrounding suburbs.\u201d",
        "doc": "In a Nov. 29 interview on Face the Nation, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan was pressed on the resurgence of the coronavirus across Michigan. \"Most new cases of the virus are in and around the city of Detroit,\" host Margaret Brennan said. Duggan challenged that premise, responding that Detroit is an outlier compared with the metro area and the rest of the state in the latest phase of the pandemic. \"Detroit actually has the lowest infection rate in the state of Michigan,\" Duggan said. \"We\u2019re half of that of the surrounding suburbs.\" Data on infection rates do show that after getting hit hard early, Detroit appears to have done a better job more recently of slowing the spread of the coronavirus than surrounding communities. But Duggan was incorrect in stating that Detroit\u2019s infection rate is the lowest statewide. And while it was running at less than half the rate of the suburban areas in the beginning of November, that\u2019s no longer the case. Nonetheless, he said Detroit can be an example for other parts of Michigan dealing with rising caseloads. \"Conventional wisdom at the start of the pandemic was that the most densely populated cities would have the highest infection rates,\" Duggan told PolitiFact Michigan. \"The people of Detroit have proven that widespread testing and masking up is what really matters in fighting the virus.\" Denise Fair, Chief Public Health Officer for the city, pointed to a number of factors that have contributed to the city\u2019s low rate of new infections in a recent interview with Bridge Michigan. Among them, Fair mentioned the free drive-thru testing site set up by the cityoriginally located at the State Fairgrounds and free transportation it offered to the site, Personal Protective Equipment shared with small businesses and community outreach and public service announcements regarding the risks associated with the coronavirus and how to prevent its spread. While the coronavirus pandemic has affected both urban and rural areas, the onset of the pandemic hit cities and their health systems particularly hard, and Detroit quickly became a hotspot for the coronavirus. At the height of its coronavirus outbreak in the spring, Detroit consistently reported more than 300 cases and dozens of deaths a day. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer responded with strict stay-at-home orders that closed schools and shuttered most businesses. The state also ramped up COVID-19 testing in hard-hit areas. Detroit\u2019s testing program, along with businesses\u2019 and residents\u2019 compliance with mask orders, helped slow the rate of infection by mid-summer. But cases are now rising again, not only in Detroit, but across the state. Health experts look at the seven-day positivity rate as one key measure of how fast infection is spreading in a community. The seven-day positivity rate is a percentage derived by taking the number of COVID-19 tests that come back positive over the previous seven days and dividing it by the number of tests administered. When Duggan made his remarks, Detroit\u2019s seven-day positivity rate was 8.2%, according to the city\u2019s Health Department. That\u2019s above the 5% threshold that the World Health Organizations considered a reasonable level for relaxing certain social restrictions. But Detroit was still doing better than surrounding areas. According to the University of Michigan\u2019s MI Safe Start Map, the seven-day positivity rate was 14.9% in Wayne County excluding Detroit, 13.4% in neighboring Oakland County and 17.5% in Macomb County, as of Nov. 25. Data from early November show larger disparities in the tri-county area, with positivity rates in Detroit dropping below 5%, less than half the rates outside the city. Indeed, the MI Safe Start Map shows that Detroit\u2019s seven-day positivity rate as of Nov. 25 was among the lowest in the state. (The figures include probable cases and exclude cases from correctional facilities.) But it wasn\u2019t the lowest, as Duggan stated. Some counties in Michigan\u2019s sparsely populated Upper Peninsula posted lower positivity rates during that period, including Alger (4.4%), Houghton (7.7%), Iron (6.7%), Luce (3.6%), Mackinac (4.1%) and Schoolcraft (5%). The population of these six counties \u2014 roughly 81,000 \u2014 is a small fraction of Detroit\u2019s population of 670,000. Rural Emmet (6.1%), Gratiot (5.6%), Leelanau (7.8%) and Mason (7.9%) counties in the Lower Peninsula also recorded seven-day positivity rates on Nov. 25 that were also lower than Detroit\u2019s. Even Washtenaw County, just west of Wayne County, had a lower rate: 6.4% as of Nov. 25. But Duggan said that the surge in infections in communities surrounding Detroit poses a public health threat to the entire metro area. \"We are one region. When Detroit got hit hard in March and April, Detroit patients were sent to outlying suburban hospitals,\" he told PolitiFact Michigan. \"Today, patients from the suburbs are being sent to Detroit hospitals, where we still have capacity. We need everybody in this region to make a real commitment to masking up and social distancing or all of Southeast Michigan will face a real hospital capacity crisis in the coming weeks.\" On Nov. 29, Duggan said that Detroit has \"the lowest infection rate in the state of Michigan\" and that the city\u2019s infection rate was half that of its surrounding suburbs. According to the seven-day positivity rate available when Duggan made his remarks, Detroit had among the lowest infection rates in the state and a better rate than surrounding areas but its rate was not the lowest in the state or half that of its surrounding communities.

        "claim": "\u201cAmericans are paying the highest price in the world for Remdesivir because the Trump administration is allowing Gilead Sciences to jack up the prices on this #COVID19 treatment.\u201d",
        "doc": "(Editors note: This fact-check was updated on Dec. 7, 2020, to include more detail on the government\u2019s ability to take patents. The new information does not change our rating.) U.S. Sen.Tammy Baldwin called for change in the prices of a coronavirus drug, placing blame on the current administration for letting the prices rise so high. Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) in a Nov. 19, 2020, tweet said Americans are paying the highest price in the world for a drug meant to combat the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to the Trump administration. The drug, remdesivir, was the first medication released after the coronavirus pandemic began. It was developed by Gilead Sciences and largely funded with money from U.S. taxpayers, according to a July 23, 2020, article from PolitiFact. The antiviral is designed to keep the virus from making copies of itself and spreading. A clinical trial in April found that patients who were given the drug recovered more quickly than those who were given placebo pills, but the study was not clear if the drug improved survival, according to an Oct. 15, 2020, report from the New York Times. Attached to Baldwin\u2019s tweet is a Nov. 16 letter to Alex Azar, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requesting information on price negotiations with the company making the drug. The letter is signed by Baldwin, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Tina Smith (D-Minnesota), Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont), Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). The senators in the letter request that the federal government take over the production and distribution of the drug with compulsory licensing authority, which could be used to acquire lower-cost versions of the drug. But is Baldwin right? Is the drug really more expensive in the U.S. than other countries? And are those prices the fault of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration? Let\u2019s break down the tweet. Americans do pay more for remdesivir than people elsewhere. In a June 29, 2020 open letter from Daniel O\u2019Day, the chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, said each dose of the antiviral medicine will cost $520 for those on private insurance in the U.S. For the entire treatment, consisting of six doses of the medicine, the cost is $3,120. For those on government-sponsored insurance, such as Medicare and Medicaid, remdesivir will cost $390 per vial, or $2,340 per treatment, the letter said. That price will also apply to those in other countries with national health care systems. Countries such as Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have national health care systems. So is the drug more expensive in the U.S.? Yes, for people on private insurance in the U.S., the drug will cost more than what people in countries with national health care systems pay. That\u2019s similar to price trends with other drugs, though, said Cody Wenthur, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Pharmacy. \"U.S. drug prices have been calculated to be about four times higher on average than prices in other nations,\" he said. And what about the claim that the Trump administration is at fault for the price of the drug? It\u2019s not that simple. The president does have a small bit of influence, said Edmund Elder, the director of the Zeeh Pharmaceutical Experiment Station within the UW-Madison School of Pharmacy. The secretary of the U.S. Department Health and Human Services is a cabinet member, chosen by the president, and that department does oversee the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And CMS negotiates drug prices for those receiving government-subsidized healthcare, setting a price that can dictate prices for the rest of the market as well, Elder said. But the government is still not directly involved, because Congress doesn\u2019t have the authority to tell companies \u2014 or the middle-man companies, called Pharmacy Benefits Managers \u2014 what to charge. \"They can\u2019t say you can\u2019t charge more for a drug,\" he said. Wenthur said the federal government actually plays little direct role in the setting of prices for the general public because it implemented rules to limit its own ability to influence drug prices. Also, the federal government is only one actor in the realm that sets the prices of prescription drugs. Other actors include health insurance companies, large employers, or other payers, all of which are typically represented by a Pharmacy Benefits Manager. But unlike other stakeholders in the process, the government can modify the rules of the system that determines prices, Wenthur said. \"Whenever shortcomings in drug pricing or health care delivery are suggested to be the fault of any given administration, it generally implies that they haven\u2019t been active enough in using their authority to optimize the system itself,\" he said. When asked about the claim that Trump could lower prices, Baldwin\u2019s office pointed to the letter, which notes the government could take over the production and distribution of the drug with compulsory licensing authority. That could be used to acquire lower-cost versions of the drug. \"The U.S. government frequently used this authority in the 1960s to acquire lower-cost versions of the on-patent drugs, and has used it to acquire patented military equipment,\" the letter says. \"Some advocates have argued that using this authority could \u2018provide adequate supply (of remdesivir) while pushing prices down.\u2019\" That power has not been used since the 1960s and 1970s, according to a 2017 study in the Yale Journal of Law & Technology, though there has been a renewed push to once again rely on compulsory licensing authority due to rising drug costs. But, in a Nov. 25, 2020 opinion piece in The Hill, Sean O\u2019Connor, a professor of law and the executive director at the Center for the Protection of Intellectual Property at George Mason University, said that by using compulsory licensing, the government would essentially be stealing the patent for remdesivir from Gilead. And while the company would be able to sue the government for full compensation if that were to happen, he said, the government is not authorized to infringe on patents any more than everyday individuals. \"Ultimately, drug prices are driven more by other factors in the health care system than by patent rights that incentivize lifesaving innovations,\" he said. Pilar Ossorio, a professor of law and bioethics at UW-Madison said that while the U.S. government has the ability to \"take\" a patent and begin licensing a drug for production to drive down prices, it\u2019s unlikely it will happen. \"I think as a policy matter (the government) sees the right of intellectual property as so powerful and useful in the development of inventions,\" she said, that the government would be highly reluctant to take such a step because it would discourage other companies from pursuing their own advances. And, she said, because of the emphasis the U.S. has put on the importance of intellectual property rights, there is a chance the U.S. Supreme Court could invalidate portions of the code that allows the government to take patents. Baldwin says Americans are paying more for remdesivir than people in other countries, and the Trump Administration is to blame. The price element is correct. On average, Americans insured by private health insurance companies could be on the hook for an additional $780 over what people in countries with national health systems may pay. But the blame element misses the mark. While Trump may have a slight influence over drug prices with his appointee to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is really no way for the administration to step in and tell Gilead to charge less for remdesivir without a change in federal laws or invoking a rarely used maneuver to effectively seize the patent from the company.

        "claim": "\u201cThe states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are\u201d in Florida",
        "doc": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted pleas from some of his state\u2019s mayors to enact statewide measures to fight COVID-19, such as a mask mandate and the power to adopt local restrictions. The day before Florida recorded its 1 millionth case, DeSantis told reporters that states in lockdown mode are faring worse than Florida. \"So I hear people say, \u2018Oh, well, Florida is open, and they\u2019re having increased cases,\u2019\" DeSantis said Nov. 30. \"Well, OK, the states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are. If you look at the per capita cases, in a lot of these states that have closed schools, businesses shuttered, some of them even post stay-at-home orders there, you see a huge increase in these cases.\" We checked DeSantis\u2019 claim that \"the states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are.\" We found that while Florida is doing comparatively well at the moment, DeSantis overstated the correlation between cases and lockdown rules. It\u2019s likely that other factors beyond just a state\u2019s rules are affecting COVID-19 rates. In an effort to reduce the spread of the virus, states have enacted \u2014 and then sometimes relaxed or lifted \u2014 various restrictions, including mask mandates, limits on restaurant capacity, and bans on large gatherings. DeSantis, a Republican, issued an order Sept. 25 that generally lifted restrictions on businesses and suspended fines for people who didn\u2019t comply. While many stores and restaurants have adopted their own mask and social distancing rules, Floridians have still packed into some bars and other gathering spots. In November, cases in Florida were on the rise, but unlike some other governors, DeSantis said he wouldn\u2019t issue new mandates. We asked Fred Piccolo, a spokesperson for DeSantis, for evidence to explain the governor\u2019s claim that cases in states that are locked down are increasing twice as fast as in Florida. Piccolo cited a New York Times state-by-state analysis, updated Nov. 30, showing which states have businesses that are mostly closed, which ones have no restrictions, and which ones are \"mixed.\" The Times also published a map showing states with stay-at-home orders or advisories. Piccolo then used the Covid Act Now website to calculate the number of cases and hospitalizations per 100,000 residents in some of the states with more stringent restrictions. We checked the numbers ourselves. We focused on the states that the Times had cited as enacting the most stringent restrictions for either businesses or residents as of Nov. 30, as well as the states that had a medium level of restrictions on both businesses and residents. All told, 10 states qualified for this group of states with high coronavirus-related restrictions. (Our list of 10 states was slightly different from the one Piccolo provided, but not substantively so.) Broadly speaking, we found that Florida\u2019s record, at least as of the beginning of December, compared favorably with most states across the country, including those with tighter restrictions. Specifically, in comparisons of coronavirus cases deaths and hospitalizations per capita, Florida ranked among the best, and better than some of the more highly regulated states. (Click on the chart to see separate comparisons for cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.) So there\u2019s something to what DeSantis said. However, there are also some important caveats. First, some of the more highly regulated states performed better than Florida did. For instance, Oregon, Washington state and California had fewer coronavirus deaths per capita than Florida did, while Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington state had lower hospitalization rates. Second, DeSantis\u2019 reference to \"twice the rate\" undercuts the strength of his argument. Out of the 10 states with the most stringent rules, only about half had per capita cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Florida\u2019s rate. Third, Florida may be faring better than many other states in fighting the coronavirus, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a lack of restrictions is to credit for better coronavirus statistics. The following chart shows 27 states, including Florida, that the New York Times\u2019 analysis found to have the least restrictive COVID-19 rules on businesses and residents. Once again, Florida ranks well compared with the other states on cases, deaths and hospitalizations. But many of the states that followed similarly low levels of restrictions as Florida did ended up with far worse outcomes. We found that 12 of the low-restriction states had double Florida\u2019s case rate, eight had double the rate of deaths, and nine had double the rate of hospitalizations. Five states had double Florida\u2019s rate in each of the three statistics \u2014 South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, and Indiana \u2014 and another five states had twice Florida\u2019s rate for two statistics. RELATED: In Nebraska, skyrocketing cases of COVID-19 put localities, governor on separate tracks It\u2019s also important to note that some states added or tightened restrictions in November, making the impact so far difficult to evaluate. The comparison with other lightly regulated states suggests that Florida may be doing relatively well for reasons other than its low-regulation policy. For example, Florida\u2019s weather makes it easier for residents to eat and gather outdoors, even at this time of year. Scientists have generally said that the virus passes from person to person less easily outdoors than in cramped indoor spaces. \"I think it\u2019s reasonable to say that the warmer weather certainly plays a part in Florida\u2019s relative success,\" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious-disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. \"It\u2019s no longer incredibly hot, necessitating indoor gathering for air conditioning, but not too cold that people need to congregate indoors for heat.\" In addition, it\u2019s hard to establish causation: Is it the loose regulation that helps reduce infection rates, or is it the low infection rates that allow for looser regulations? Miami-Dade, the state\u2019s most populous county, had an increase in cases following the removal of the mitigation strategies, said Mary Jo Trepka, chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Florida International University. \"We don\u2019t know how bad it will get,\" Trepka said. It\u2019s also important to remember that states aren\u2019t walled-off jurisdictions. During much of the pandemic, Florida has been open to tourists, which means we don\u2019t know whether coronavirus transmission within Florida is increasing infections in other states after those tourists return home, said Marissa Levine, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. Jason L. Salemi, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida, cautions that the success DeSantis claimed is only in comparison with other states, and that cases and hospitalizations have been rising over the last few weeks. \"That, to me, is indicative of how serious the situation is across the country,\" he said. DeSantis said, \"The states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are\" in Florida. Currently, Florida does have relatively low rates of coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations. But the connection between those statistics and Florida\u2019s light restrictions on businesses and residents is less clear-cut than DeSantis suggests. Only about half of the 10 most stringently regulated states saw rates of cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Florida\u2019s \u2014 DeSantis\u2019 benchmark. Meanwhile, numerous other states that followed the same less restrictive policies as Florida have fared far worse than Florida. This suggests that factors other than behavioral regulations, such as warm weather, may play a role in keeping coronavirus infections relatively low in Florida. We rate the statement Half True.",

        "claim": "\u201cPeople of color and those of not, they use marijuana at the same rate. People of color are three times more likely to get arrested and convicted.\u201d",
        "doc": "Virginia will go to pot next year if Gov. Ralph Northam has his way. The Democrat says he will have legislation introduced this winter that would make Virginia the 16th state - and the first in the South - to legalize marijuana. One of his main reasons, he says, is to end a racial injustice. \"People of color and those of not, they use marijuana at the same rate. People of color are three times more likely to get arrested and convicted,\" he said during a Nov. 20 radio interview on WAMU in Washington. We fact-checked his statement. Marijuana use by race The first part of Northam\u2019s claim, that Black and white people use pot at the same rate essentially holds up, according to a 2018 national survey on drug use by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: 18% of Black respondents and 17% of whites said they had used marijuana during the last year; 12% of Black respondents and 10% of whites said they had used it in the last month. A 2017 survey by HHS showed showed nearly identical results: 17% of Black respondents and 16% of whites said they had used marijuana during the last year; 12% of Black respondents and 10% of whites said they had used it in the last month. In Virginia, the 2018 survey found 7% of Black respondents and 6% of whites said they had used marijuana in the last month; 12% of Black respondents and 11% of whites said they had used it in the last year. Marijuana arrests Reports show a racial discrepancy in marijuana-related arrests in Virginia and across the nation. The Virginia General Assembly\u2019s watchdog agency - the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) - issued a draft report in November with data on the state\u2019s pot arrests from 2010 through 2019. It found 1 people per 1,000. In other words, Black people in Virginia were 3.5 times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana. That\u2019s very similar to findings in a study issued by the American Civil Liberties Union on April 20, 2020. The study said Black peoples were 3.4 times more likely than white people to be arrested in Virginia for marijuana crimes in 2018. Virginia ranked 27th among 49 states that provided data to the ACLU, which wants marijuana to be legalized (Florida did not cooperate). Nationally, Black people were 3.6 times more likely than white people to be run in for marijuana between 2010 and 2018, according to the ACLU. . JLARC found that, from 2015 through 2019, Black people were more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana in each of 88 Virginia localities from which there was enough data to draw a conclusion. The largest discrepancy was in Carroll County, where Black people were 40.4 times more likely than white people to be run in for pot. InHanover County, Black peoplewere 14.8 times more likely thanwhite people to be arrested for marijuana.The racial disparity was 6.4 times higher for Black people in Richmond, 5.2 times higher in Henrico County, and four times higher in Chesterfield County. According to JLARC, Virginia averaged 22,000 marijuana arrests a year during the last decade. \"The vast majority...have been for possession of small amounts of marijuana,\" the agency wrote. \"There were about 10 times as many arrests for marijuana possession as for distribution or other marijuana offenses.\" Marijuana convictions JLARC found that Black people in Virginia were four times more likely than white people to be convicted on marijuana charges from 2010 to 2019. Four Black people per thousand were found guilty, compared to one white person per thousand. According to JLARC, 58% of all state marijuana arrests in 2018 resulted in convictions, the vast majority of them winding up with \"fines, court fees and driver license suspensions.\" Forty percent of the cases were dismissed by prosecutors or judges, and 2% resulted in not-guilty verdicts. JLARC found Black people were more likely to be prosecuted on pot charges in each of 83 localities where there was enough data to draw a conclusion. Our ruling In his bid to legalize pot in Virginia, Northam said, \"People of color and those of not, they use marijuana at the same rate. People of color are three times more likely to get arrested and convicted.\" Surveys show Black people and white people do use pot at just about the same rate in Virginia. But Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to get arrested in Virginia for marijuana offenses, and four times more likely to get convicted. If anything, Northam has slightly understated his case, but we don\u2019t usually penalize for that. We rate his statement True. ",

        "claim": "\"In 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much.\"",
        "doc": "Has Milwaukee\u2019s position as Wisconsin\u2019s largest city as well as a Democratic stronghold put Brewtown in the crosshairs of state Republicans? State Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, alluded to the city\u2019s treatment by Republicans about a week before the election, in an Oct. 26, 2020, tweet marking National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week: \"I'm so glad we have a Governor who cares and wants to help WI cities get to 0% lead piping. Sadly, in 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much.\" That caught our attention. Did Republican lawmakers strip funding from the budget for lead pipe replacement because it would help Milwaukee too much? Under Evers' plan, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, state officials would have borrowed nearly $40 million over the two-year budget period to create a forgivable loan program for local governments to help pay for lead pipe replacements. The borrowing also would have created a separate grant program that would allow farmers to build infrastructure aimed at reducing pollution and help rid contaminants in the Milwaukee River and St. Louis River, which is in northwest Wisconsin. Evers' proposal would have paid for up to 50 percent of the cost of replacing a lead water service line in Milwaukee, if the city qualified for the state program. According to Milwaukee Water Works, there is no lead in the city\u2019s drinking water when it leaves treatment plants. But there is a danger in the water -- especially in older homes -- because old service lines, which run to individual houses, and interior plumbing may contain lead, which can leach into the water. The most fundamental solution, in Milwaukee and elsewhere, is to replace the old pipes with copper ones, but other interim steps can make a difference, such as assuring at-risk homes have filters on their taps. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to cause developmental delays and learning difficulties in children. Lead exposure also harms adults, who may suffer high blood pressure, joint pain, headaches and an increased risk of having a miscarriage or premature birth. As of Dec. 31, 2019, the Milwaukee Water Works reported 74,416 lead service lines within its service area, according to Department of Public Works spokesman Brian DeNeve. About 70,000 of those are residential. Those 70,000 residential lead service lines account for about 40% of the total statewide. The proposed $40 million in bonding could have led to the replacement of 9% of the state's 170,000 lead service lines still in use, the Evers administration estimated. When asked to provide backup for Larson\u2019s statement, spokesman Justin Bielinski pointed to news articles detailing GOP objections in the wake of the Evers proposal. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said the plan was too expensive. \"I feel like the simple answer was to just say we're going to have government pay for all these lead lateral replacements,\" Vos said, according to an April 10, 2019, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. \"But the number nationwide is trillions of dollars, which we will never have the ability \u2014 at least in Wisconsin \u2014 to be able to do things like that everywhere across the state.\" In the same article, state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, who co-chairs the Legislature\u2019s budget-writing committee, singled out the Milwaukee funding. \"My understanding is that the proposal \u2014 a vast majority of it \u2014 is going to Milwaukee,\" Nygren said. \"We had targeted our response to the lead issue as a local opportunity for communities to get involved and provide assistance at the local level, rather than people from Marinette funding lead replacements in Milwaukee. I'm not sure that that's necessarily fair from a taxpayer standpoint.\" Meanwhile, a video titled \"Milwaukee Tries to Pass the Buck on Lead Lateral Replacement\" posted May 20, 2019 by the MacIver Institute to YouTube, shows Vos praising Madison\u2019s efforts to replace lead laterals on its own, without a state mandate, and notes the laterals are owned by homeowners, not taxpayers. \"The City of Madison did a great job over the past dozen years getting rid of lead laterals on their own without a mandate from the state,\" Vos said. In the video, Vos says those who have already paid to upgrade their laterals should not have to now pay the cost of replacing laterals owned by others. In its description of the video, the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank, describes this as a \"handout\" to the city from state taxpayers. In May 2019, the Legislature voted along party lines to remove many of Evers\u2019 most significant proposals from his state budget, including the lead proposal. So, in short, before striking the money from the budget, several GOP leaders cited the fact too much of it would go to Milwaukee. But they also cited other factors, including questioning whether an effort financed by state taxpayers was an appropriate way to tackle the problem. In a tweet, Larson said \"In 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much.\" At least two key leaders opposed the program, citing -- in part -- the amount of money that would go to the City of Milwaukee. But there were other factors cited as well. Our definition for Mostly True is \"The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\" That fits here.",

        "claim": "Says COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years.",
        "doc": "Like many states, North Carolina is tracking a record number of COVID-19 cases this holiday season. And in an attempt to explain the severity of the illness, the state\u2019s top health official compared coronavirus deaths to data on the flu. \"Sadly more than 5,000 North Carolinians have lost their lives from this virus since our first death on March 12 of this year,\" Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said during a Dec. 1 press conference. \"To give some perspective, just under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years,\" Cohen said. \"In just 11 months, Covid has killed more than three times that number.\" Is it true that the coronavirus has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years? According to the state\u2019s data, yes. North Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services tracks both COVID-19 and influenza deaths. As of Wednesday morning, the state had counted 5,284 COVID-19 deaths. DHHS says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for COVID-19, who died without fully recovering from COVID-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified. The deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments. The first reported COVID-19 death did, indeed, occur on March 12. The state\u2019s health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu season\u2019s data on its website. Flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test. PolitiFact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. In total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate. Here\u2019s a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season: 2019-2020: 186 2018-2019: 203 2017-2018: 391 2016-2017: 218 2015-2016: 59 2014-2015: 218 2013-2014: 107 2012-2013: 59 2011-2012: 9 2010-2011: 36 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. At a glance, it might seem like the CDC and North Carolina reports contradict one other. For instance, the CDC reported North Carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the state\u2019s health department reported far less. That\u2019s because the CDC sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said. Under the \"flu & pneumonia\" section on the CDC\u2019s flu deaths by state website, \"most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths,\" said Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Some pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by \"many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi,\" said Kelly Haight, DHHS spokeswoman. The year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the CDC site. If you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, Lancashire said \"there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone \u2013 without pneumonia (from the public database CDC WONDER \u2013 wonder.cdc.gov).\" \"So if Dr. Cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that COVID19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in NC,\" he said. The CDC has noted, however, that tallying death counts for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete. Cohen said COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years. By the North Carolina health department\u2019s count, there have been 5,200 COVID-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade. Cohen\u2019s claim also tracks with data collected by the CDC, according to an agency spokesman. However, the CDC points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information. We rate her statement True.",

        "claim": "\u201cRepublican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks\u201d were spreading \u201ca lie\u201d about his daughter breaking COVID-19 restrictions.",
        "doc": "While explaining why his family would not be together celebrating Thanksgiving this year, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker blasted online accusations that his daughter broke COVID-19 protocols at a restaurant gathering. \"A parody Twitter account posted a picture of a group of individuals eating outside a Chicago restaurant, supposedly breaking the COVID rules the city put in place,\" Pritzker said at a Nov. 17 press conference. \"And the person posting the photo claimed one of the people in it was my daughter.\" \"My office put out a statement making clear this wasn\u2019t my daughter,\" Pritzker said. \"But that didn\u2019t stop Republican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks from telling people that the picture was of my daughter, despite knowing that this was a lie.\" Pritzker said his teenage daughter, Teddi, was in Florida with his wife, and would \"remain there indefinitely\" because she had started receiving \"hateful and threatening messages.\" Teddi is not identifiable among the group of 14 diners in the published photo. So we decided to find out where the misinformation came from and who had shared it. What we learned shows the governor was correct about how the rumors spread. The photo was originally shared on Twitter by an account called @deuxmoiworld, according to a thread written by Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff, Anne Caprara. That account links to a website that describes it as a purveyor of \"rumors and conjecture.\" By the time we checked it, the image was deleted and the account\u2019s operator had apologized for sharing it. But the image was already being spread on other Twitter accounts, Caprara documented in her thread, including one that described itself as \"a parody account.\" Then a website with connections to conservative political operatives called Chicago City Wire picked it up, publishing a post based solely on the parody account\u2019s tweet. That account\u2019s tweets are now private. The story does not say which person in the photo is purportedly Pritzker\u2019s daughter nor what date the photo was taken, though servers in the background are wearing masks. Chicago City Wire is produced by Local Government Information Services, a company run by conservative radio talk show host Dan Proft, state records show. In October, Proft was featured in a New York Times investigation into a nationwide string of local sites that purport to be news sites, but are instead vehicles for stories ordered up by GOP groups and corporate PR firms. In 2015, Proft teamed up with another controversial internet entrepreneur, Brian Timpone, to start a chain of such publications in Illinois. Proft and Timpone did not respond to requests for comment. Following complaints to the Illinois Board of Elections about political funding behind the Illinois sites, the Times reported, a disclaimer on their \"About\" pages now says they are funded, \"in part, by advocacy groups who share our beliefs in limited government.\" That disclaimer now appears on Chicago City Wire. We confirmed with Pritzker\u2019s office these were the websites he was referring to as \"propaganda publications.\" Propaganda includes \"ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause,\" according to Merriam-Webster. While there\u2019s room for disagreement about the perimeters of the term, Pritzker\u2019s use of it to describe these sites is reasonable in light of the New York Times\u2019 findings. Pritzker\u2019s spokeswoman also pointed to Proft\u2019s radio show, Chicago\u2019s Morning Answer to explain his reference to \"radio shock jocks\" sharing the story. On the Nov. 13 episode of the show, a listener called in to ask co-host Amy Jacobson and a guest host if they would confront the governor about City Wire\u2019s story. Jacobson dismissed that suggestion, but still gave credence to the claim that Teddi was pictured, saying, \"I\u2019m glad that she\u2019s out socializing outside, I\u2019m glad that she\u2019s living and not existing.\" When reached by phone, Jacobson declined to comment for this fact-check. Several state Republican lawmakers also chose to share the post, backing up the most serious portion of Pritzker\u2019s claim. \"Like I\u2019ve been saying from the beginning, this is how you handle a lockdown!\" Rep. Darren Bailey of Xenia wrote in a Facebook post sharing the City Wire story. Bailey\u2019s post has since been shared by more than 700 of his followers. Rep. Grant Wehrli of Naperville also retweeted a post from a Twitter user who shared the story. That user has since apologized for spreading false information and deleted her original tweet. Neither Bailey nor Wehrli responded to email inquiries or calls to their district offices asking why they believed the post was credible. Pritzker said \"Republican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks\" were spreading \"a lie\" about his daughter dining outside at a restaurant with a large group of people during the COVID-19 pandemic. The false claim Pritzker is referring to is based on a photograph of 14 individuals gathered around a table, none of which are identifiable as his daughter. It was spread by gossip and parody accounts on Twitter before being picked up by a website operated by a company that accepts money from partisan groups and is run by a conservative talk show radio host whose co-host later repeated the claim on-air. While definitions of \"propaganda\" may vary, Pritzker\u2019s use of the term here is reasonable given the context. Two GOP state lawmakers also shared the post on social media. We rate Pritzker\u2019s claim True. TRUE \u2014 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.

        "claim": "\"People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work. Already, the numbers are really staggeringly low.\"",
        "doc": "A vaccine to prevent coronavirus infections is tantalizingly close, with the first inoculations in the United States weeks or even days away. But concern persists that not enough Americans will be willing to be vaccinated to fully halt the virus\u2019 spread. President-elect Joe Biden raised this concern during a Dec. 3 interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. When Tapper asked whether Biden planned to be vaccinated before he\u2019s inaugurated on Jan. 20, Biden said he would. \"People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work,\" Biden said. \"Already, the numbers are really staggeringly low. And it matters what a president and a vice president do. \u2026 And it's important to communicate to the American people it's safe to do this.\" We interviewed seven experts for this story. They expressed disappointment with Americans\u2019 relatively low willingness to take the vaccine so far, and they were especially concerned about deeper skepticism of a vaccine among racial minorities. But they added that these early findings do not mean that the effort is doomed. Most of the polling so far has asked about a vaccine that was still theoretical. Now, several vaccines have been presented to regulators with strong initial results, and if the initial rollouts are smooth \u2014 and if targeted educational efforts begin to have an effect \u2014 the experts expect Americans to become more comfortable with taking a vaccine. (The Biden campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Since May, at least seven pollsters have taken a look at Americans\u2019 willingness to receive a coronavirus vaccine. Most polls have found between 50% and 70% of respondents willing to get vaccinated. (Some of the differences may stem from differences in how the question was worded in each poll.) Respondents\u2019 stated willingness to receive the vaccine fell in the summer and the early fall before recovering somewhat in October and November. Observers said this might have to do with early, positive results for several vaccine trials \u2014 making a vaccine less theoretical to Americans \u2014 or relief among Democratic survey respondents that Joe Biden will be president during most of the vaccine rollout, rather than Donald Trump. To understand the public\u2019s wariness about a coronavirus vaccine, it helps to take into account \"the politicization of the virus and seemingly everything surrounding it, as well as the level of misinformation being circulated,\" said Jason Salemi, an associate professor of public health at the University of South Florida. While less-than-optimal levels of vaccination will still help ease the pandemic, epidemiologists say that something approaching full eradication can occur only if most people receive their shots. \"Given what we know about the virus so far, we are going to need higher proportions of people to take the vaccine then who are now saying they will for protection to occur on a population level,\" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor in Claremont Graduate University\u2019s school of community and global health. An especially important issue is that some subgroups of the population are less welcoming of a coronavirus vaccine than the public at large. While 33% of white respondents to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll said they would probably not or definitely not take the vaccine, the rates were higher for Hispanics (37%) and Blacks (49%). A survey by the COVID Collaborative found that 14% of Black respondents and 34% of Hispanic respondents said they mostly or completely trust that a vaccine will be safe. Only 18% of Black respondents and 40% of Hispanic respondents said they mostly or completely trust that a vaccine will be effective. Most analysts attribute the hesitancy about vaccines in the Black community to a legacy of unethical medical experimentation, as well as longstanding disparities in the quality of health care available to racial minorities. \"There are historical reasons that justify that caution and skepticism,\" said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine, health policy and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. If Black Americans do end up forgoing vaccination at especially high rates, it could be especially problematic, since rates of illness and death from COVID-19 have been higher for Blacks than for whites. One reason for this may be their added risk of exposure. \"Minority groups are overrepresented among essential workers, and these are groups that are among the most important for the vaccine to reach,\" Gatto said. Before assuming widespread vaccine skepticism will lead to poor vaccination rates, it\u2019s worth noting some context. Flu vaccination coverage among adults in the United States has fluctuated between 37% and 48% in the past decade, Salemi said. Compared against the widely available vaccine for the flu, the survey data for a coronavirus vaccine is \"not \u2018staggering,\u2019\" Salemi said. In addition, there\u2019s evidence that older Americans \u2014 those who are more susceptible to the virus\u2019 worst impacts \u2014are more willing to get vaccinated. For instance, a CNN poll in October found that 60% of those age 65 and older said they would try to get a vaccine, compared with 49% among those younger than 45. And history suggests that concerted public education campaigns can help boost low public confidence. \"Successful mass-vaccination campaigns have been carried out previously in the United States, including for polio in the 1950s and more recently for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,\" said Matthew B. Laurens, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine\u2019s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. \"Maintenance of public trust will depend on clear messages to the public regarding vaccine benefits and side effects, transparency of vaccine developers and researchers regarding what is known and is not known about available vaccines for COVID-19, and continuous engagement and dialogue with communities and individuals.\" Campaigns can work well by leveraging community members, faith leaders, celebrities and athletes \u2014 \"people who can demonstrate by example,\" Gatto said. Ultimately, though, one of the biggest factors driving lower-than-desired public approval of a coronavirus vaccine is simply an understandable caution about trying something new. \"A dose of healthy skepticism is normal,\" Schaffner said. \"These are new vaccines with new technologies against a new virus.\" Experts agree that the public\u2019s view of vaccines can change, since Americans are being bombarded every day by new information about the virus and possible vaccines. \"We have to be realistic about the ebb and flow as more information comes out about the particular vaccines \u2014 how the initial vaccination efforts go, and what happens to the first folks taking it,\" said Mollyann Brodie, executive vice president for public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"Even today, we don't yet have a vaccine that has been given the green light by the FDA, and most of these surveys were taken before data from Moderna and Pfizer were released,\" added Tara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiologist. Experts express cautious optimism that a smooth rollout will ease concerns among Americans who are currently reluctant. \"I do think the comfort level with the vaccine will indeed increase over time,\" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. Also important to remember \"is that we have some time,\" Schaffner said. \"We can\u2019t vaccinate everybody in a week and a half.\" Biden said, \"People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work. Already, the numbers are really staggeringly low.\" Experts agree that the initial percentages of Americans saying they\u2019re willing to take the vaccine are lower than would be ideal to fully eradicate the coronavirus, and that the numbers are especially low among racial and ethnic minorities even though those groups have been hit disproportionately by the pandemic. However, experts aren\u2019t despairing yet, because they see public opinion as fluid and likely to be shaped by new information, including regulatory approvals and the rollout of the actual vaccines. History has also shown that concerted educational efforts can help increase comfort with new vaccines. We rate the statement Half True.",

        "claim": "Says Kelly Loeffler \u201cwelcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview.\u201d",
        "doc": "In a Georgia debate that could help decide which party controls the Senate, Black pastor Raphael Warnock went after white businesswoman Kelly Loeffler on race. \"And she says she is against racism and that racism has no place,\" Warnock, the Democratic challenger, said of Loeffler, the GOP senator. \"But she welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview. I don't think she can explain that.\" Warnock was referring to Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, a supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, and conservative activist Jack Posobiec, who once interviewed Loeffler. Warnock, pastor of the Atlanta church once led by Martin Luther King Jr., has repeatedly made the claim against Loeffler. In the debate, Loeffler didn\u2019t respond directly to the two-part attack, but said: \"There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body.\" Loeffler did embrace an endorsement from Greene in a campaign event, so that part is true. The evidence Warnock relies on for the other part of the claim doesn\u2019t flatly label Posobiec as a white supremacist, but notes that he has ties to people in that movement, and Posobiec and has praised some of them. The QAnon conspiracy theory claims public figures like Hillary Clinton, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey are part of a ring of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles, and that President Donald Trump is secretly fighting to bring it down. The FBI has described the QAnon movement as a potential domestic terrorism threat. But Greene, a former construction executive heading to Congress, has called it \"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out,\" and has made derogatory remarks about Black people, Jews and Muslims. Loeffler appeared with Greene at an Oct. 15 campaign event to tout her endorsement from the House candidate. By then, Greene had won a primary runoff to represent Georgia\u2019s safely Republican 14th congressional district. Loeffler praised Greene\u2019s defense of \"conservative values.\" \"I've gotten a lot of work done in Washington already in that regard \u2014 and I'm thrilled to know I've got a strong, conservative champion that's going to be fighting right alongside with me,\" Loeffler said of Greene. In the Nov. 3 election, Greene won easily, becoming the first open supporter of QAnon to win a seat in the U.S. House. Loeffler gave an interview July 31 to Posobiec, who is known as a conservative activist and is a correspondent for One America News Network, a conservative cable news channel. Loeffler highlighted the interview, which aired on OANN, on her campaign\u2019s Twitter account. She said she did the interview \"to discuss why I had to call out\" theBlack Lives Matter \"political organization \u2014 and why the woke mob is trying to cancel me.\" To back its claim about Loeffler sitting for an interview \"with a white supremacist,\" Warnock\u2019s campaign cited a news report about Posobiec from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a report about Posobiec from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a social justice nonprofit that in recent years has been criticized over some of its tracking of hate groups. Those reports talk about Posobiec\u2019s association with white supremacy. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution led its article about the Loeffler interview by saying Posobiec is \"associated with white supremacy and Nazism.\" The article said Jewish groups and media observers pointed out that Posobiec \"promotes conspiracy theories and once associated with white supremacists including Richard Spencer.\" Posobiec has praised Spencer, a white nationalist who was one of the leaders of the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where a white supremacist rammed a car into a counterprotester, killing her. The Southern Poverty Law Center, in a report published July 8 on its Hatewatch blog, said Posobiec \"collaborated for years with white supremacists,\" including Spencer. \"Posobiec\u2019s ties to far-right extremists travel beyond borders into Europe. His connections to white supremacy are too numerous to compile into one article, so Hatewatch is running a series of stories on the correspondent\u2019s ties to the movement and promotion of it.\" The center does not include Posobiec on its list of white nationalists, or its broader list of extremists. \"The only reason we have not formally listed Posobiec yet is that we are still reporting out his history within hate movements,\" Michael Edison Hayden, who wrote the Hatewatch blog post on Posobiec, told PolitiFact. \"We have more to publish about Posobiec soon, also related to promotion of an anti-immigrant politician and his collaboration with white supremacists. Do not interpret the current absence of his extremist profile as a suggestion that he is somehow less extreme than figures like Richard Spencer.\" Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said Posobiec \"has apparently cozied up to various white supremacists.\" Loeffler \"should know that granting an interview to such a person, while criticizing those who point out his bigotry and disturbing associations, legitimizes the toxic views he so dutifully promotes.\" Loeffler\u2019s campaign and Posobiec did not respond to our requests for comment. Warnock said Loeffler \"welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview.\" Loeffler did welcome the endorsement of her campaign by a QAnon supporter. Loeffler gave an interview to a man who has praised a prominent white nationalist and who, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \"collaborated for years with white supremacists.\" The center does not include the interviewer on its list of white nationalists, but says it is continuing to investigate him.

        "claim": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused four of the eight \u201cdeadliest days in American history.\u201d",
        "doc": "There\u2019s no question the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the deadliest events modern Americans have ever grappled with. But how its death toll compares with other tragedies and natural disasters is being misconstrued in a social media post that purports to list and rank the \"deadliest days in American history.\" The graphicshows that four of the eight deadliest days since the country\u2019s founding took place between Dec. 2 and Dec. 7, 2020. The image places daily COVID-19 deaths from those days alongside death tolls from the Galveston Hurricane, the battle of Antietam, Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This post, which was forwarded to us by a reader,was alsoflagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Facebook.) Most of the figures cited are accurate and the general thrust of the claim is valid: The pandemic has produced staggeringly high daily death counts that reached 3,411 on Dec. 9 \u2014 a high that came after the image was created. Families have relayed haunting stories of heartbreak as their loved ones have died in isolation without the comfort of family members close by. However, the post contains some problems: It does not take into account daily deaths not linked to a specific cause, and it omits some historical events that resulted in greater numbers of fatalities. Although the image purports to be a list of the \"deadliest days in American history,\" it only lists fatalities related to specific mass-fatality events. It leaves out the number of deaths from all causes. For example, the list cites Dec. 4, 2020, as having a death toll of 2,861. It\u2019s true that 2,861 people were reported on that day to have died of COVID-19, according to the CDC\u2019s Data Tracker. This number doesn\u2019t include any of the people who died from causes besides COVID-19, such as murder, heart attacks or cancer. In 2017, an average of 7,708 deaths occurred each day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The list doesn\u2019t provide an accurate list of the top eight deadliest days in American history. Perhaps the most notable omission from the list is also the most directly analogous to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 1918 flu pandemic savaged the United States between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31, 1918, killing an estimated 381,019 people in those four months alone. That\u2019s an average of around 3,123 people per day. Other notable mass fatality events left out of the chart include: The Battle of Gettysburg, where an estimated 10,000 soldiers were either mortally wounded or killed over three days of fighting. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which killed 3,400 people according to an official fatality count conducted by archivist Gladys Hansen. The San Ciriaco hurricane, which killed 3,369 people in Puerto Rico on Aug. 8, 1899. The Lake Okeechobee hurricane, which killed an estimated 2,500-3,000 people on Sept. 16, 1928. And while the chart seems to focus on events that have claimed lives on U.S. soil, it does not explicitly say that. The D-Day invasion during World War II claimed the lives of 2,501 Americans, according to the National D-Day Memorial Foundation. Liz Skilton, an associate professor of history at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, who specializes in natural disasters, disapproved of the way the image compared different types of disastrous events by placing them side by side. \"Different types of disasters rarely ever can be compared directly as there are different sets of hazards and reactions to these hazards that influence the outcome of events,\" she said. \"This is not to say disasters cannot be compared at all, it just means that making direct comparisons between them in an oversimplified way is damaging to our understanding of their impact and could even harm our ability to react to these incidents appropriately.\" All that said, the numbers that the chart does rely on are generally accurate. The Battle of Antietam resulted in about 3,600 deaths, and the attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in about 2,400 deaths according to the National Park Service. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 killed an estimated 8,000 to 12,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The 9/11 attacks killed an estimated 3,000 people according to the 9/11 Commission Report. The COVID-19 deaths in the chart are taken directly from the CDC\u2019s Data Tracker. A viral image claims that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused 4 of the 8 \"deadliest days in American history.\" The image omits some historical events and only lists fatalities linked to specific causes. However, the broad claim of the image is accurate: the COVID-19 pandemic has seen daily death totals that have surpassed those of events memorialized as national tragedies, including Pearl Harbor and 9/11. We rate this image Half True.\u200b",

        "claim": "Says David Perdue \u201chasn't held a single public town hall meeting in six years\u201d and \u201csells four meetings a year and a retreat on a private island for a $7,500 corporate PAC check.\u201d",
        "doc": "In a debate where he appeared alongside an empty lectern, Democrat Jon Ossoff attacked his absent Republican opponent, saying Georgia Sen. David Perdue hasn\u2019t been accessible to his constituents and has sold his time for donations from political action committees. Perdue \"hasn't held a single public town hall meeting in six years,\" Ossoff declared Dec. 6. \"He openly sells access for corporate PAC checks. He sells four meetings a year and a retreat on a private island for a $7,500 corporate PAC check.\" Perdue\u2019s campaign manager has indicated the first-term senator won\u2019t do any debates with Ossoff ahead of their Jan. 5 runoff election. Along with another Georgia runoff the same day, which pits Democrat Raphael Warnock against GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the race will determine which party controls the Senate. As for town halls, Perdue\u2019s Senate office did not cite any that Perdue has held. Ossoff\u2019s claim about donor access refers to a solicitation for a Perdue campaign fundraising event. That invitation shows political action committees that contributed $7,500 annually (not a single contribution) would qualify to attend quarterly events and an annual \"sea island retreat.\" A town hall, as it\u2019s typically understood, is a meeting that is publicized in advance and open to the public, in which the elected representative answers questions from members of the public that are not screened. Traditionally, these have been in-person events, but particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, more have been held online. We found no evidence that Perdue has held such a meeting, and his office didn\u2019t offer any. Ossoff has been making the town halls claim about Perdue since at least August, and we found several media reports about Perdue not holding public forums. In May, the student-run Harvard Political Review reported that Perdue had not held any town halls since he took office in January 2015. Atlanta TV station WGCL reported in August about Perdue\u2019s lack of accessibility to the public, and noted the Harvard story. In September, Atlanta TV station WXIA referred in a news report to a 2017 Perdue event that drew protesters. It didn\u2019t describe the event, but said Perdue hasn\u2019t held a town hall since then. Perdue\u2019s staff did not respond to those reporters for those stories. But in 2017, Perdue told reporters he had held \"impromptu\" town hall meetings while making an unannounced visit to the state Capitol, and that he prefers holding meetings with individuals or small groups. The nonprofit Town Hall Project told PolitiFact that Perdue has not held a public town hall since it began tracking town halls held by members of Congressin January 2017. The project uses staff and volunteer researchers to track lawmakers\u2019 public schedules, subscribe to their newsletters, follow them on social media and visit their websites, said executive director Nathan Williams. Accordingto the Town Hall Project, a meeting is a town hall if it is open to the public and the press; announced with at least 24 hours\u2019 notice; and has at least 30 minutes of open questions and answers; that is, the questions are not screened. Perdue's Senate office told PolitiFact that he regularly participates \"in public events and local visits to hear directly from\" constituents. The office did not cite any town hall event, either in person or online, but said Perdue has held \"constituent conference calls\" since taking office, including weekly calls during the COVID-19 pandemic. It\u2019s not clear whether those calls were publicized in advance or whether constituents were allowed to ask Perdue questions that weren\u2019t screened by staff. His office didn\u2019t comment on those issues. To back the second part of Ossoff\u2019s claim, his campaign cited a two-part tweet from Dave Levinthal, who was then an editor-at-large for the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics and is now a Washington correspondent for Business Insider. The June 5, 2019, tweet showed images of an invitation to a Perdue fundraising event the same day that was hosted by Perdue Victory, a joint fundraising committee of Perdue\u2019s campaign and One Georgia PAC, which is affiliated with Perdue. The invitation solicited annual donations at three levels from individuals and political action committees for the Boardroom, an effort helping Perdue\u2019s 2020 re-election run. At the top level, called \"Chairman,\" a PAC donating $7,500 per year or an individual donating $5,400 per year would be invited to an annual retreat at Sea Island, a private community on St. Simons Island in Georgia, including a reception at Perdue\u2019s residence; \"invitations to special events throughout the year\"; \"quarterly events\"; and an \"end-of-year thank you.\" Images ofa fund-raising solicitation to supportSen. David Perdue's reelection campaign were posted on Twitter by journalist Dave Levinthal: The invitation did not say whether Perdue would be at all the events. Perdue\u2019s office did not comment on the fundraising solicitation, and his campaign did not respond to requests for comment. WXIA-TV reported in February 2020 that on Feb. 13, 2019, Perdue attended a meeting of his Boardroom donors, and did not attend a Senate hearing held at the same time by two Armed Services subcommittees on substandard military housing at Georgia\u2019s Fort Benning and other facilities nationwide. Perdue is a member of one of the subcommittees. Perdue\u2019s office released a statement saying the senator \"has taken strong action to improve military housing at bases in Georgia,\" but didn\u2019t address his scheduling on Feb. 13, 2019, according to the news report. Ossoff said Perdue \"hasn't held a single public town hall meeting in six years\" and \"sells four meetings a year and a retreat on a private island for a $7,500 corporate PAC check.\" Perdue\u2019s office said the senator has held weekly conference calls with constituents. But we found no evidence that Perdue has held a town hall \u2014 a meeting publicized in advance, open to the public and allowing the public to ask him unscreened questions \u2014 since he took office in January 2015. An invitation to a 2019 campaign fundraising event for Perdue offered political action committees that made an annual donation of $7,500 access to an annual retreat at Perdue\u2019s residence in a private community on St. Simons Island, Ga., as well as access to quarterly meetings and other events, though it was not clear whether Perdue himself would attend each event.

        "claim": "\u201cWisconsin is one of the few states that doesn\u2019t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day.\u201d",
        "doc": "It took all day and then some for Milwaukee election officials to count their mountain of absentee ballots in the 2020 presidential election And those 170,000 votes proved decisive. When the ballots were added to the state total about 3:30 a.m. Nov. 4, Wisconsin swung from a lead for President Donald Trump to a lead for former Vice President Joe Biden. A later canvass and recount confirmed Biden won the state by about 21,000 votes. But the swing and timing sparked an avalanche of misinformation, with Trump and an array of other Republicans claiming there was something nefarious about the late arrival of Milwaukee\u2019s votes. Of course that\u2019s ridiculous: We\u2019ve noted in multiple False and Pants on Fire ratings that the absentee votes from Milwaukee, a Democratic stronghold, were long expected to heavily favor Biden and to come in late. The controversy stems from limitations in state law on when election workers can process absentee votes \u2014 limitations that were unchanged despite the massive increase in this kind of voting amid the pandemic. State Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee, raised this point in a letter to the state\u2019s Republican legislative leaders, seeking a bipartisan task force to improve Wisconsin\u2019s voting system. \"Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn\u2019t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day,\" Carpenter said in the Dec. 11, 2020, news release. \"Allowing this simple change would stop the false accusation that tens of thousands of ballots are secretly being dumped after midnight changing the outcome of the election. We all know our current process and know that is not true. It is just a matter our laws requiring workers to wait until 7:00 AM on Election Day to begin tabulating.\" Is Carpenter right that Wisconsin law handcuffs election officials in a way most states don\u2019t? The short answer is yes. The longer answer depends a bit on how you define processing. The National Conference of State Legislatures compiled details on how each state handled absentee ballots for the 2020 election. Their research showed many states limit counting of absentee votes to Election Day \u2014 about 30 in all. But few go as far as Wisconsin in not allowing any ballot processing until that day. Only Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wyoming require that ballots not be processed until Election Day. (Michigan requires smaller cities to wait until Election Day, while those with 25,000 or more people can start a day early.) The timelines vary among the other states, with some allowing ballots to be processed as soon as they are received, while others begin the process a set amount of time before Election Day. A New York Times breakdown of when states are allowed to begin \"pre-processing\" ballots \u2014 defined as verifying signatures, opening envelopes and flattening ballots to get them ready for tabulation \u2014 shortened that list further, showing only Alabama, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin limiting this to Election Day. We saw dramatically different vote reporting dynamics in states that allow this earlier ballot processing. In North Carolina, for example, where absentee votes can be processed five weeks before the election and counted two weeks before, an early lead for Biden turned into a Trump win as in-person votes were added to the tallies later in the day. Carpenter said Wisconsin is one of the few states that don\u2019t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day. However we define that processing, it\u2019s clear Wisconsin in the extreme minority. Just a handful of states ban election workers from beginning work on absentee ballots before Election Day. We rate this claim True.",

        "claim": "\u201cMillions of Hubbell and Bloomberg dollars wasn\u2019t enough to overcome the Iowa House Republican avalanche of success.\"",
        "doc": "Post-election hand-wringing is well underway among Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats asking themselves why their performance in this year\u2019s general election in Iowa was so disappointing when they commanded a significantfundraising advantageover Republicans. Iowa\u2019s Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate Theresa Greenfield, for example, raised more than twice the amount of her opponent, Republican incumbent Joni Ernst. YetGreenfield lostby almost 7 percentage points. That trend proved true in Iowa\u2019s state and local races as well. Iowa Republicans flipped seven Iowa House seats and maintained control of all their Senate seats, even though the Iowa Democratic Partyoutraisedthe Republican Party of Iowa by almost $3 million. Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann made note of that when hetweetedon Nov. 27 that \"Sir Frederick Hubbell literally blew 100s of thousands of dollars on #ialegis races where there were plenty of reasons to believe the GOP would win, but he had an ax to grind with the family or candidate.\" Sir Frederick Hubbell literally blew 100s of thousands of dollars on #ialegis races where there were plenty of reasons to believe the GOP would win, but he had an ax to grind with the family or candidate. Hubbell's rather infantile anger certainly got in the way of common sense. It was a reference to Fred Hubbell, a wealthy Des Moines businessman who is a significant Democratic Party donor and the party\u2019s 2018 candidate for Iowa governor. In a subsequenttweeton Nov. 28, Kaufmann wrote: \"Millions of Hubbell and Bloomberg dollars wasn\u2019t enough to overcome the Iowa House Republican avalanche of success. Sir Frederick and Little Mike have the political skills of President Millard Fillmore.\" Millions of Hubbell and Bloomberg dollars wasn't enough to overcome the Iowa House Republican avalanche of success. Sir Frederick and Little Mike have the political skills of President Millard Fillmore. #ialegis #iapolitics TheWhite House biographyof Millard Fillmore describes the nation\u2019s 13th president as an \"uninspiring man.\" We looked at whether Hubbell and Bloomberg really spent millions so ineffectually during the general election. Bloomberg, the billionaire former Mayor of New York who ran for president unsuccessfully this year, is known as a Democratic fundraising giant and has donated to Iowa campaigns in the past. He donated $250,000 to Hubbell\u2019s 2018 gubernatorial campaign and another $250,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party that same year,campaign reportsshow. This year, however, Bloomberg did not donate money to Iowa\u2019s state legislative candidates or the party, according to data from theIowa Elections and Campaign Disclosure Board, so spending by him could not have been thwarted by Republican House success in the election. Hubbell is a different story. The former gubernatorial candidate who lost to Republican Kim Reynolds in 2018, Hubbell continued to be a regular Democratic Party donor in 2020. Hubbell has donated $156,450 to Iowa Democratic candidates for the Legislature and Democratic organizations since Jan. 1, financial disclosure reports examined at the beginning of December showed. Hubbell\u2019s wife, Charlotte Hubbell, donated $5,350, and combined, the two have donated $164,300. While individual contributions to campaigns are important, political action committees (PACs) are another aspect of campaign finance. Because PACs are not as tightly regulated as campaign committees, it\u2019s difficult sometimes to know where that money comes from or what is done with it. But, we know that theBetter Democracy PAC, which Fred and Charlotte Hubbell founded in 2019 with the goal of flipping the Iowa House,donated $1,150,864to Iowa House candidates, the Democratic Party and party funds such as ActBlue and Path to Victory. It\u2019s fair to say that Fred Hubbell spent thousands of dollars in this election cycle. Judging whether or not that money was put to good use is a subjective call. Neither Hubbell nor the Better Democracy PAC could be reached for comment when PolitiFact tried to contact them. Of the 23 Democratic state legislative candidates whom the Hubbells and the Better Democracy PAC donated to directly, eight won and 15 lost. Of those who won, two won by more than 10 percentage points and two ran unchallenged. Of those who lost, six lost by more than 10 percentage points and two lost by almost 30 percentage points. Other races were more tightly contested, though, with some being decided by just a few hundred votes. We tried to reach Kaufmann for comment for this story several times but did not hear back from him. The claim that Michael Bloomberg spent substantially in this year\u2019s Iowa legislative races is false. He did not donate directly to any legislative candidates in 2020. He donated to political organizations that, in turn, donated to other political organizations that sent money to Iowa candidates, but others also contributed to those organizations to support Democrats in several states. Saying Bloomberg donated to the organizations to pump thousands of his dollars to Iowa would distort how that funding is distributed. Hubbell, on the other hand, donated to Iowa legislative candidates, both personally and through the Better Democracy PAC. While the motivation behind Hubbell\u2019s spending is unclear, it\u2019s true that several of the candidates Hubbell supported were defeated handily by Republicans, a point Kaufmann can make in his argument about Hubbell. However, other Democratic legislative candidates Hubbell supported financially won or lost by just a few hundred votes, indicating some of those races were competitive. We\u2019re splitting the difference here with the claims about Bloomberg\u2019s spending false and Hubbell\u2019s spending true, for a rating for the tweet of Half True.",

        "claim": "\u201cTens and tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair, some on the verge of collapse.\u201d",
        "doc": "Democrats have argued for decades that jobs, economic growth and progress on climate change all meet at the Transportation Department. As he announced his transportation secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg, President-elect Joe Biden hit each of those points, plus the simple need for safety. \"Tens and tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair, some on the verge of collapse, presenting a clear and present danger to people\u2019s lives,\" Biden said Dec. 16. Bipartisan efforts to deal with the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure are a fairly regular occurrence, and for good reason. Over 40% of bridges are at least 50 years old. State and local governments repair them regularly, but Biden\u2019s words focused on the work that remains. Based on government numbers, Biden described the challenge fairly accurately, although experts told us his words about the immediate risk are overblown. Bridges are generally closed before they reach the stage where a collapse is imminent. A construction trade group, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, reported that over 46,000 bridges meet the definition of \"structurally deficient.\" In layman\u2019s terms, that means key parts of those bridges, perhaps steel struts or concrete supports, are rusting, cracked or otherwise in poor shape. Such bridges must be inspected every year, and engineers know that they need significant work, if not total replacement. There are different ways to calculate the number of structurally deficient bridges. The Congressional Research Service said there were 56,000 in 2016, representing about 9% of the total. The transportation builders use a lower number, with data current through 2019. That group estimates about 7.5% of the nation\u2019s total fall into the worst category. The danger of crumbling bridges is real, and it\u2019s not limited to the most deteriorated ones. A chunk of concrete from a bridge in Michigan injured a woman in February 2020 as she drove under it. The bridge was rated as being in \"fair\" condition, a notch below \"good\", and a notch above \"poor.\" A state official told the local newspaper it was \"not the worst bridge out there.\" If Biden\u2019s comment about the number of bridges in the worst shape is on the money, his warning about bridges \"on the verge of collapse\" is overly dire. \"There are no bridges in the U.S. that are open that are in danger of imminent collapse,\" said the American Society of Civil Engineers\u2019 Maria Lehman. The operative word is \"open.\" While hidden design flaws, such as the one behind a 2007 fatal bridge collapse in Minneapolis, might be out there, inspection data does not show that motorists are driving over bridges that could crumble beneath them. Under federal guidelines, state inspectors rate bridges on a 0 to 9 scale, with zero being \"failed condition\" and 9 being \"excellent condition.\" \"At a 3 (serious condition), generally bridges are closed,\" Lehman said. Chung C. Fu, director of the University of Maryland\u2019s Bridge Engineering Software and Technology Center, amplified that point. \"If the rating drops to 2 or less, the bridge is long since closed,\" Fu said. Bridges vary greatly. The Congressional Research Service noted that about 80% of structurally deficient bridges are in rural areas. \"These bridges tend to be small and relatively lightly traveled,\" they wrote. The transportation builders group estimates it would cost $164 billion to bring every bridge up to snuff. As a fraction of each state\u2019s inventory, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Iowa have the greatest need, with about one out of five bridges deemed structurally deficient. There is some good news. Over the years, the fraction of bridges in poor shape has gone down, from nearly 11% in 2004 to just over 7% in 2019. Federal spending to repair them was as high as $9 billion in 2009 under the Great Recession recovery package. Since then, it has hovered around $6 billion. Biden said there are \"tens and tens of thousands\" of bridges in disrepair, and some are on the verge of collapse. At least 46,000 bridges are rated to be in the worst shape. Most are in rural areas and are lightly used. Contrary to Biden\u2019s dire description, engineering experts told us that no one is driving over bridges that could come down at any moment. Random events and human error aside, transportation officials close bridges before they reach that point. The accuracy of Biden\u2019s words is mixed. We rate this claim Half True.",

        "claim": "\u201cSchools that are consistently implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies remain among the safest places for our students.\u201d",
        "doc": "On Nov. 12, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson issued modified guidelines that redefined the need for student quarantines: A student doesn\u2019t have to quarantine if the student comes into contact with someone who has COVID-19 but is wearing a mask. It\u2019s part of Parson\u2019s continuing push to keep children in schools rather than doing learning remotely. This guidance contradicted CDC guidelines, which recommend quarantine for anyone who has spent at least 15 minutes within 6 feet of an infected person. In unveiling the guidelines, Parson said: \"Schools that are consistently implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies remain among the safest places for our students.\" Which made us wonder: What are these strategies, and do they do enough to assume that those schools are safe? The CDC says schools may consider implementing several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19. CDC suggests that all school reopening plans address adherence to behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19. When used consistently and correctly, along with important mitigation strategies, masks are important to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Other important guidelines noted by the CDC are social distancing, washing hands, and regular cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in schools and buses. Dr. Rachel Orscheln, associate professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University and St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital, joined Parson in announcing the policy. \"We also know that some of these children will likely, at some point in their illness, be at school,\" she said. \"However, we have learned that in schools where students and staff are always wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, this virus does not spread as easily as it does in other places where these strategies are not always used.\" Parson\u2019s team also directed us to CDC Director Robert Redfield. At a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Nov. 20, he said: \"The truth is, for kids K-12, one of the safest places they can be, from our perspective, is to remain in school.\" Data from the CDC determined children under the age of 18 make up only 10% of cases in the U.S., even though they represent 22% of the total population. Also, an international research study out of Spain has found that school reopenings are not the cause of community coronavirus surges. According to the Missouri Department of Senior Health Services and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the minimum protocols schools should follow involve screening, physical distancing, and mask wearing. These techniques are proven to reduce the spread of the virus if implemented. A Syracuse University study found that careful use of surgical masks along with good ventilation reduced the estimated infection rate to 2%. Missouri\u2019s protocols are in close alignment with the CDC\u2019s recommendations on how to safely operate schools during COVID-19. Missouri has no mandate to ensure that these recommendations are followed; there is no statewide mask mandate in schools. Additional data has found that children are less likely to contract and spread COVID-19 at school. Brown University economist Emily Oster studied in-school infection data from 47 states during the end of the September. Among more than 200,000 students and 63,000 staff who had returned to school, Oster determined an infection rate of 0.13% among students and 0.24% among staff compared to a national average of 4.8%. But, in a research study from the American Association for Medical College (AAMC), associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University School of Medicine Benjamin Linas said, \"You can only open your school safely if you have COVID under control in your community.\" For example, the Missouri communities with the two highest COVID-19 rates are St. Louis County and St. Charles County. Their schools have mitigation strategies in place but there is still evidence students contract COVID-19 in their communities and bring it to the classroom. About 3,066 of the coronavirus cases in St. Charles County were linked to exposures in schools. The St. Louis Department of Health noted that \"schools in St. Louis County have seen significant transmissions of COVID-19 among teachers and students.\" There is a clear correlation between the safety of a community\u2019s school and the number of cases in that community. \"You can have the best laid plans in classrooms, but if kids are not following social distancing and mask usage outside of school, they\u2019re going to bring COVID into the school with them,\" the AAMC study says. Parson said, \"Schools that are consistently implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies remain among the safest places for our students.\" Parson is correct to affirm the data and statement from the CDC Director Robert Redfield regarding COVID-19 and children in schools, but Parson\u2019s statement does not reflect the risk of opening a school with mitigation strategies in areas where there are high COVID-19 rates in the community. We rate this claim Mostly True. CORRECTION, Dec. 18:This story has been updated to include more recent data from the CDC for the percentage of children with COVID-19 and the correct link to an international research study from Spain.",

        "claim": "\"New data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases.\"",
        "doc": "The ideological split on in-person schooling during the pandemic was pretty predictable through most of 2020. Those who generally favored lockdowns and other strong mitigation measures opposed in-person schooling, while those who derided lockdowns, mask orders and the like typically supported it. Like much related to COVID-19, however, positions have shifted on this issue as more data and studies have emerged. One prominent Wisconsin Republican says that research now supports a more widescale return to the classroom. \"It's time to get kids back in school,\" U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay,said in a Dec. 7, 2020, tweet. \"New data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases, and school closures leave us with the worst of both worlds: students falling further behind without a significant impact on slowing the spread.\" Is Gallagher right that in-person learning isn\u2019t driving a spike in cases? In a word: Yes. The push against virtual schooling \u2014 embraced by most school districts starting in March \u2014 has strengthened as a growing body of research shows the toll being out of the classroom takes on learning. In fall 2020 assessments, students in grades 3 to 8 performed similarly to same-grade students last year in reading, but 5 to 10 percentage points lower in math, according to a November report from NWEA, a research-based nonprofit group that assessed 4.4 million students. A November report from Renaissance Learning Inc. similarly found students falling behind in math, with some grades 12 weeks or more behind. The move online has in many cases worsened existing socioeconomic achievement gaps as well, since online learning works only when students have consistent internet access and home support, according to research compiled by the Economic Policy Institute and others. Meanwhile, the science shows school doesn\u2019t present the risk many experts expected. As with many other pandemic response measures, the diversity of local guidelines governing schools has created a natural experiment. \"Children and schools are not the main drivers of the epidemic across countries,\" said a UNICEF report published in November. \"Evidence shows that the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them. Data from 191 countries show no consistent association between school reopening status and COVID-19 infection rates.\" An international research report out of Spain found a similar lack of correlation, as did a study by Insights for Education that said there is \"no consistent pattern between school status and infection levels.\" Even Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is now advocating for a measured return to in-class instruction. \"The default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school, or to get them back to school,\" he said on ABC\u2019s \"This Week\" on Nov. 29, 2020. \"If you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all, not like one would have suspected. So, let's try to get the kids back, but let's try to mitigate the things that maintain and just push \u2026 community spread\" like capacity seating indoors at restaurants and bars. One project run by Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University, has gathered data from 13 million in-person students (some multiple times) since September, in partnership with schools around the U.S. That data showed an infection rate of 2.2 students per 1,000 over a two-week period. The staff infection rate over that span was 4.2 per 1,000. (Wisconsin was notably worse in both categories, averaging 7 infections per 1,000 students and 19 per 1,000 staff members) \"The numbers are small \u2014 smaller than what many had forecasted,\" Oster wrote in an Atlantic article detailing her early findings in October. CDC data shows children under age 18 make up about 10% of cases in the U.S., though they comprise 22% of the total population. (Children account for just 0.1% of deaths.) The key asterisk is that in-person instruction is safest when mitigation measures remain in place in both schools and the community. The CDC recommends use of masks and following other guidelines such as social distancing, washing hands, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in schools and buses. PolitiFact Missouri noted this in rating Mostly True a claim that schools using these strategies \"remain among the safest places for our students.\" Jordan Dunn, press secretary for Gallagher, cited this research and Fauci\u2019s comments in defending Gallagher\u2019s statement. \"That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t transmission in schools and schools should re-open without common sense safety measures,\" Dunn said in an email. \"But the data that has been collected suggests, as Rep. Gallagher states, that in-person learning is not driving spikes in cases and schools are not super-spreaders.\" Gallagher said, \"New data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases.\" Indeed, research from an array of sources in October and November show in-person instruction has not been tied to increased cases in those areas. Key leaders including Fauci have acknowledged classroom instruction caused fewer issues than expected, leading him to support a shift away from virtual learning. We rate this claim True.",

        "claim": "\u201cJurisdictions representing about 80% of WI residents have passed referendums or resolutions in favor of fair maps.\u201d",
        "doc": "When Republicans won the Legislature and governor\u2019s office in 2010, the party was in the driver\u2019s seat for a vital function: Redrawing district maps to account for population changes. Those maps led to a range of lawsuits -- which generally failed -- accusing the GOP of unfairly gerrymandering districts to give the party an unfair advantage at the polls. Ten years later, as we approach another round of redistricting, the political landscape has changed, in that Democrat Tony Evers now holds the governor\u2019s office. Has it changed more than that? State Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) claimed in a Nov. 9, 2020 tweet that jurisdictions representing about 80% of Wisconsin residents have passed resolutions or referendums in support of fair maps. \"All told, jurisdictions representing about 80% of WI residents have passed referendums or resolutions in favor of fair maps,\" he wrote in the tweet. \"Gerrymandering is an affront to our Democracy, and I will continue to fight for WI leg. maps that reflect the will of the people, not the party in power.\" Is he right? In 2011, maps were drawn behind closed doors. Republican lawmakers and their aides were required to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to look at maps of their own proposed districts before the public could see them. The maps prompted a swirl of lawsuits, with Democrats alleging that Assembly districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered to give Republicans an advantage. In the end, Democrats ended up dropping the gerrymandering case, according to a June 2019 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal courts can\u2019t consider allegations that partisans drew election maps to favor themselves. During the decade, Democrats won back only three Assembly seats, including two during the 2020 elections, according to a Nov. 3, 2020 Journal Sentinel article, and one in 2018, according to an Oct. 29, 2020 PolitiFact report. Evers, elected in 2018, has called for a nonpartisan commission to look at Census data and draw fair maps. He included the proposal in his first budget, but it was denied. Instead, he created the panel by executive order in 2019, according to a July 2020 article from the Journal Sentinel. His panel bars party officials, lawmakers and former lobbyists from joining it. In practice, it\u2019s unclear what that will mean in 2021. Republicans in the Legislature have not signed onto the commission idea, so they may pursue maps of their own -- though this time they would need support from Evers, instead of former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican. If the two sides deadlock, the matter would end up in front of a judge. In addition to the action by Evers, various local government bodies have been going on the record in support of \"fair maps.\" They range from Lincoln County to Milwaukee County. The wording varies, but generally speaking they ask for the creation of nonpartisan procedure for the preparation of legislative and congressional redistricting plans to increase accountability and transparency. These referendums are at the center of Larson\u2019s claim. When asked for evidence to back Larson\u2019s claim, aide Justin Bielinski noted the senator wasn\u2019t the only one to cite the 80% number -- that Gov. Tony Evers had even done so in the announcement of the People\u2019s Maps Commission. Bielinski also cited information from the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonprofit, non-partisan government watchdog group that has tracked gerrymandering, 55 counties have passed either resolutions, referendums or both. Referendums are voted on directly by residents, while resolutions are voted on by county boards. The population of those counties adds up to 4.8 million people, according to the group. The state has about 5.8 million residents, based on the latest census data. Thus, those numbers mean nearly 83% of Wisconsinites are represented by jurisdictions who have signaled support for fair maps. Larson said \"jurisdictions representing 80% of Wisconsin residents\" passed referendums or resolutions \"in favor of fair maps.\" According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, jurisdictions representing about 82% of Wisconsin\u2019s population have approved either a referendum, resolution or both in support of fair maps. We rate this claim True. ",

        "claim": "Says that the oil and gas industry comprises35% of the Texaseconomy.",
        "doc": "Texas\u2019 oil and gas sector took a tumble in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic was compounded by a SaudiArabia-Russia price war that further devastated the global oil market. In May, two weeks after crude oil prices turned negative for the first time in history, Texas Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick spoke with the Texas Tribune giving updates on how the industry was handling the downturn. \"Last year, [oil and gas] was about 35% of the state's economy ... and so [because this industry] is down ... it's gonna affect everything,\" Craddick said. Craddick repeated that same figure in a tweet earlier this month as she advocated for prioritization of the Railroad Commission \u2014 the state\u2019s oil and gas regulatory agency \u2014 in next year\u2019s state budget. \"Oil and gas is 35 percent of the state economy, making the (Texas Railroad Commission\u2019s) budget an important priority,\" she said. Texas oil and gas producers have suffered the double blow of COVID-19 and the global price shock amid an era when the industry is facing a process of structural contraction. Oil and gas has long been a primary driver of Texas\u2019 prosperity, but does its share of the state economy remain at 35% even after a historically tumultuous year? Determining the oil and gas\u2019 industry\u2019s share of the state economy \"is a hard number to pin down,\" said Jesse Thompson, senior business economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. There\u2019s a multitude of ways an industry\u2019s economic impact can be measured, Thompson said. Impact could be an industry\u2019s share of a state\u2019s gross state product, or the number of jobs it creates, or the amount of income it generates, or some combination of the three. Furthermore, there are three different levels upon which economists analyze economic impact: an industry\u2019s direct, indirect and induced effects on the economy. Direct effects include the revenue generated by oil and gas companies; indirect effects include the businesses supplying equipment or services to those oil and gas companies; and induced effects include the spending of people in the industry as a result of increased personal income. For example, induced impacts could include an interior decorator in Houston who is hired by an oil and gas employee. \"There\u2019s a lot of very reasonable ways to break this up, that\u2019s why there\u2019s not necessarily a right answer,\" Thompson said. Direct impacts are the most straightforward measurement. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal agency, the oil and gas sector directly comprised around 15% of the state\u2019s gross state product between 2019 and early 2020. That share fell to around 14.2% as the coronavirus swept the globe and forced the industry to shed jobs and shut down drilling rigs in the second quarter of 2020, the latest period for which economic data is available. According to Craddick\u2019s spokesperson, the 35% figure Craddick cited represents the oil and gas sector\u2019s direct impacts to the gross state product combined with its indirect and induced impacts. The 35% figure is also a projection for how the year will end after the industry\u2019s bounce back from its April nadir. \"We have seen improvements throughout the remainder of the year, so the number is definitely going to land somewhere between 30% and 40%, so 35% was an easy middle point,\" said Craddick\u2019s Director of Public Affairs Mia Hutchens. Certain indicators are already showing the sector\u2019s recovery. The Texas rig count has shown a slight uptick since October corresponding with an improving global demand for oil and natural gas. After nearly 60,000 oil workers lost their jobs between February and August, around 2,100 jobs were added in September and October, according to the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association. The associationalso projects that, by year's end, the industry will be supporting at least 300,000 direct jobs and 2.1 million indirect jobs in Texas. The 35% projection was calculated using data from the Texas comptrollers office, the Texas Pipeline Association and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, the sector\u2019s largest industry group in the state, according to Hutchens. At the beginning of 2020, before COVID-19 had reached all corners of the globe, the Texas Oil and Gas Association pegged the industry\u2019s share of Texas\u2019 gross state product at 30.5%. According to a spokesperson, the trade groupdetermined that number by finding the sum of the industry\u2019s direct contributions to Texas\u2019 gross state product\u2014 $223.1 billion, or about 13.5% of the state economy. Then, to capture the industry\u2019s indirect and induced \"ripple\" effects, the Oil and Gas Association multiplied the industry\u2019s direct gross state product by 2.3, meaning that every dollar spent in the industry was modeled to generate $2.30 inspin-off economic activity. This multiplier produces an estimated $502.6 billion of economic impact in the state, or 30.5% of the private sector\u2019s gross state product. To Karr Ingham, a petroleum economist with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, the association's method of calculation using a multiplier of 2.3 is \"pretty close to correct.\" \"That\u2019s not high. If anything that could be a touch low,\" Ingham said. \"I\u2019ve heard commissioners in the past and other political types and other industry cheerleaders say the multiplier for oil and gas is 7.\" Before the pandemic, Texas producers were coming off a couple of downyears in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, about four years after the global oil prices collapsed and slammed the brakes on Texas\u2019 fracking boom, the industry was hampered by a credit crunch as lackluster oil prices remained volatile. By mid-2019, oil jobs were in decline as companies struggled to provide steady income and growth. \"It\u2019s been the worst-performing sector on the S&P for the last couple years,\" said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. \"If you take the value of all the producers and add them together, by 2019 they collectively were worth less than Apple.\" According to Gilmer, there are \"at least three tough quarters in front of us\" before the industry will begin to reassert itself and shake off lasting effects of the pandemic. \"By the time we get to 2022 \u2014 and it will take that long for us to feel really good about the economy \u2014 oil and the U.S. economy will be back,\" Gilmer said. Craddick\u2019s 35% figure reflects the commissioner\u2019s belief that the industry will begin next year stronger than it began 2020. Although several indicators point to an upward trajectory of the industry \u2014 like oil prices, jobs, and rig count \u2014 Karr said the 35% projection may be slightly optimistic. \"It\u2019s a little hard to take issue with [Craddick\u2019s number] just because it\u2019s guesswork,\" Karr said. Craddick said earlier this month that the oil and gas industry comprises 35% of the Texas economy. Craddick'soffice clarified that this figure represented the industry\u2019s combined direct, indirect and induced economic impact, and that it represents a projection of how the industry will end the year after its recent bounce back. The oil and gas industry has comprised as much as 40% of the state economy during the last decade\u2019s fracking boom, yet shrunk to 30% before the pandemic shocked the world economy. Firm quarterly data showing the industry\u2019s recent gains will not be released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis until late 2021. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "\u201cIn my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again.\u201d",
        "doc": "When President Donald Trump threatened to reject the coronavirus economic relief package passed with wide bipartisan support, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey appeared on Fox News to defend the plan and stress how urgently businesses need relief. \"In my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again,\" Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said Sunday before Trump relented and signed the measure into law. We wondered how sweeping the latest round of virus shutdowns is and what types of establishments are affected. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf halted indoor dining, closed casinos, gyms, and entertainment venues, and lowered retail occupancy limits statewide for the first time since the spring. The new restrictions came as the state started reporting more than 10,000 new infections per day. Wolf said he hoped the restrictions would slow the spread of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed just before vaccines become widely available. \"This is a bridge to a better future in Pennsylvania,\" Wolf said. Before this latest round of closures, all 67 Pennsylvania counties had been in the \"green\" phase of the Wolf administration\u2019s three-step reopening plan since July 3, even though Trump falsely claimed otherwise on the campaign trail. That allowed many businesses to operate at 75% capacity. Since the new rules took effect on Dec. 11, the number of new cases reported each day in Pennsylvania fell to as low as 4,621 on Dec. 27, and the seven-day average fell to 7,757. The restrictions are set to expire on Jan. 4, but Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said the state may extend them if cases climb again in the days ahead. A local ban on indoor dining in Philadelphia will remain in effect until Jan. 15. Soon after Wolf announced this latest round of restrictions, at least a dozen gym and restaurant owners across Pennsylvania publicly vowed to defy them. Business owners argued they should be allowed to stay open because internal data they collected showed their establishments hadn\u2019t been the source of any community spread. A recent Stanford University study, however, linked restaurants, gyms, and crowded indoor spaces to 80% of infections in 10 U.S. cities in the early months of the pandemic. \"If I have to prove my point by being taken out in handcuffs, then so be it,\" said Phil Guarno, who owns Fenicci\u2019s Italian restaurant in Hershey, Pa., which has remained open for indoor dining despite the new order. \"It\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s really do or die. It\u2019s time to stand up against this tyranny.\" The relief bill includes a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses like Guarno\u2019s, as well as temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefits for the unemployed and $600 direct payments to most Americans. Schools, healthcare providers, and renters facing eviction will also get relief. Across the country, at least seven other states and the District of Columbia have joined Pennsylvania and imposed restrictions on large numbers of businesses. They include Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Ten states have halted activity at some businesses, and elsewhere, establishments remain largely open even as the pandemic rages on. Toomey said \"in my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again.\" He\u2019s right that Pennsylvania shuttered many businesses earlier this month, and seven other states have imposed similarly sweeping restrictions. We rate Toomey\u2019s statement True.",

        "claim": "Says Illinois has made a \"nation-leading\" investment in funding for Census outreach.",
        "doc": "Illinois stands to lose tens of millions in federal money over the next decade if it undercounts its citizens on the 2020 Census effort. That\u2019s why Illinois and other states across the nation are collectively spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure every eligible citizen is counted. In an Oct. 13 tweet, Gov. J.B. Pritzker suggested Illinois leads the nation in that effort. \"Earlier today, my administration announced an additional $1M (million) in funding for Census outreach, on top of our historic & nation-leading $29M (million) investment,\" Pritzker tweeted. Given that other, larger states share the same incentive for an accurate count, we decided to check out the claim. The National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks Census spending by state, publishes data showing Illinois ranks second among states in total spending at $31.5 million, below California at $187 million. The NCSL previously had New York above Illinois as well, at $60 million, but has since revised it down to $20 million. When asked why the governor said Illinois is \"nation-leading,\" his top spokeswoman, Jordan Abudayyeh, said her boss\u2019s tweet was referring not to total spending, but to spending per citizen, or per capita. By that measure, Illinois\u2019 $2.40 per person in Census spending ranks third in the nation, behind New Mexico at $5.50 per person and California at $4.70 per person, based on NCSL\u2019s state spending figures and 2019 U.S. Census population estimates. Abudayyeh said the top-three ranking suffices to call Illinois \"nation leading.\" \"Illinois is in the top three of states, so we are \u2018nation-leading\u2019 in that regard,\" she said. In the past, Pritzker\u2019s statements about Illinois\u2019 supremacy in Census spending have at times been less ambiguous. In a Dec. 4 statement, he left little doubt he thought Illinois ranked number one \u2014 a claim that has never been true. \"We have committed $29 million, as was mentioned earlier, to prepare and execute the Census,\" Pritzker announced. \"And that is by far, in the United States, the most on a per capita basis that\u2019s being spent in any state.\" When the governor made that announcement, California topped the list, according to a report by The Associated Press published a week earlier on Nov. 23. Several months later, New Mexico catapulted to the top of the per-capita spending list with an additional appropriation of $8 million. Denice Ross, a senior fellow at the National Conference on Citizenship who worked for more data transparency on the Census, said that while the term \"nation-leading\" is not precise, it is fair given Illinois\u2019 level of spending compared to almost all other states. \"\u2018On top of our historic and top-three among states $29 million investment\u2019 would be technically more accurate,\" Ross said. \"Twitter of course makes it awkward.\" Pritzker said, \"Earlier today, my administration announced an additional $1M in funding for Census outreach, on top of our historic & nation-leading $29M investment.\" While Illinois did not spend the most on Census outreach, it did rank in the top three among all other states.

        "claim": "\u201cPeople are less likely to just vote for party now. \u2026 They\u2019re looking at the personalities.\u201d",
        "doc": "In a year and an election that has been polarized at every turn, are voters focusing more on party or personality? That\u2019s the question a freshman state representative addressed while discussing \u2014 in part \u2014 how President Donald Trump is faring among suburban women. Those voters are a key demographic for Trump, one he has been overtly courting in the runup to the presidential election. At a mid-October rally in Pennsylvania. Trump declared: \"Suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please.\" As part of an Oct. 25, 2020, segment on suburban women on WISN-TV\u2019s UpFront program, state Rep. Robyn Vining said this: \"We get a lot of calls from national press asking what\u2019s happening here so that they can try and understand what the shift is in the suburbs, but I think people are less likely to just vote for party now,\" said Vining, D-Wauwatosa. \"I really believe that they vote for people, so they\u2019re looking at the personalities who are running for office \u2014 who can they trust? It\u2019s not just who do I want to have a beer with now, it\u2019s also who can I trust, who can I trust to fight for me like they\u2019re fighting for their own family. And I think moms look at it that way.\" So Vining was presumably asked about Trump\u2019s support in the suburbs \u2014 the TV clip doesn\u2019t show what exactly she was responding to \u2014 but her statement offers a broad assertion that voters in 2020 are considering personality more than they have in the past. Let\u2019s take a look. If we interpret Vining\u2019s comment to narrowly address suburban women\u2019s response to Trump, there\u2019s a truth there. \"It is clear that their support for Trump actually has dropped off quite a lot,\" said Kenneth Mayer, professor of American politics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"All of the data point to the fact that what is changing the attitudes of these voters is Trump, his sort of personality and operating style.\" A New York Times analysis by UCLA Professor Lynn Vavreck said polls show suburban white women are among the groups with the largest swings away from Trump in 2020 compared to 2016. But Vining\u2019s statement seems to make a broader claim about voters choosing based on personality, and \"the evidence does not support that,\" Mayer said. The frequency of ticket splitting \u2014 voters who support candidates from multiple parties on the same ballot \u2014 and the general polarization of the country show Americans are making party-based decisions now more than ever. An analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com found ticket splitting hit an all-time low in 2018, the last time many states had an election offering voters a candidate from multiple parties in a statewide election (senator and governor, for instance). The median difference between the margin of victory in the senate and gubernatorial races has regularly declined since at least 1998, hitting a low in 2018. In other words, voters are increasingly unlikely to vote for one party for senate and another for governor. That analysis concluded \"more voters are casting straight-ticket ballots. There are exceptions, of course, but this shift matches what we know about the larger electoral picture: voters are more partisan and the country is more divided than it\u2019s ever been in the modern era of U.S. politics.\" A Pew Research Center poll conducted Sept. 30 to Oct. 5 found only 4% of registered voters supported Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden and a U.S. Senate candidate from the opposing party. And Trump\u2019s approval rating offers further proof of the polarization, particularly when it comes to the president. The party split on his approval rating is the largest ever recorded by the Gallup poll, which goes back to President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. In the Oct. 16-27, 2020, Gallup poll, 95% of Republicans approved of Trump\u2019s work in the White House, compared to 3% of Democrats \u2014 a 92-point gap. Before Trump, the largest gap recorded was a 77-point difference during President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office. Vining said, \"People are less likely to just vote for party now. \u2026 They\u2019re looking at the personalities.\" Looking narrowly at Trump\u2019s support among suburban women, there\u2019s a case this is accurate. Trump\u2019s abrasive approach doesn\u2019t appear to be resonating with that group, and fewer appear likely to support him than in 2016. But Vining\u2019s comment was more general than that. And broadly speaking, party is playing a growing role in voters\u2019 decisions \u2014 not a shrinking one. Voters are less likely than in the past to cast ballots supporting candidates from multiple parties. And they\u2019re more likely than ever to agree with people from their own party when assessing something like the president\u2019s job performance. We rate this claim Half True.",

        "claim": "Poll watchers in Philadelphia prevented from entering polling places.",
        "doc": "As Pennsylvania voters headed to the polls for their last chance to vote in the 2020 election, posts on social media claimed there was a lack of transparency in the election process. \"A poll watcher in Philly was just wrongfully prevented from entering the polling place,\" Will Chamberlain, editor-in-chief of the conservative magazine Human Events, tweeted Nov. 3. His tweet includes a video that shows two people standing at a doorway and telling a third person that he cannot go in. \"You are not letting me in?\" the man asks the couple. \"No,\" they replied. \"I have a city-wide watcher\u2019s certificate,\" the man starts saying. \"It\u2019s not for this location,\" a woman at the door tells him. The man seeking entry tells the couple that the certificate says it\u2019s \"good in every ward and division in the city.\" The 33-second video, which has been viewed more than 2.3 million times, ends with the man remaining outside. Chamberlain\u2019s tweet was retweeted by Mike Roman, director of Election Day operations for President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. \"DEMOCRAT ELECTION OFFICIALS BANNING TRUMP POLL WATCHERS IN PHILLY. This is happening all over the City. The steal is on!\" Roman tweeted. Kevin Feeley, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia City Commissioners, which is in charge of elections in the city, told PolitiFact that what happened in the video was \"a mistake\" on behalf of the people running the polling site. \"It was a misunderstanding of the law,\" Feeley said. However, the man eventually went to another polling site, where staff who better understood the law let him inside, Feeley said. Feeley said this is what happened: the poll watcher went to a polling site in Philadelphia this morning, but the judge of election (the person who runs that particular polling place) thought that the watcher could not be let into that particular location, because a ward and division number on the watcher\u2019s certificate did not correspond with that site. That used to be an old rule \u2014 that a watcher could only be admitted to a specific ward and division. \"That is no longer the law,\" Feeley said. The judge of election was eventually told the watcher could be admitted into that location. \"We corrected the problem with the judge of election, we addressed it,\" Feeley said. Feeley said that the poll watcher left the site shown in the video and went to another site, \"and the judge there correctly understood the law and (the poll watcher) was admitted into that site.\" \"We regret that it happened, it was an honest mistake,\" Feeley said. \"It appears to be the only mistake of its kind.\" Chamberlain in a follow-up tweet posted a picture that he said showed the poll watcher\u2019s certificate. The picture says that the watcher\u2019s name is \"Gary Feldman,\" representing Trump. The picture of the certificate does not include any other identifying information. PolitiFact was unable to reach Feldman to confirm if he was the person in the video and whether he was able to enter another site as a poll watcher. Tweets claimed that poll watchers in Philadelphia were prevented from entering polling places. A poll watcher was denied access to one polling site in Philadelphia because the person in charge of that particular polling place was not up to date on the law, which allows watchers to enter any site, not just the ward and division site specified on the watcher\u2019s certificate, said Feeley, a spokesperson for Philadelphia City Commissioners. The same poll watcher went to another site and was allowed to go in, according to Feeley. Feeley said that the judge of election who had inaccurate information was updated on the new rules, and that there is \"no evidence that it was a systemic problem.\" The posts are partially accurate but leave out important details or take things out of context.

        "claim": "\u201cWest Virginia is near last in the U.S.\u201d rankings of education, clean drinking water, and child mortality.",
        "doc": "Paula Jean Swearengin, the Democrat who challenged Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., in 2020, took to Twitter to argue that their state needs to improve its standing in some key quality-of-life metrics. Swearengin was replying to a tweet by Andrew Yang, who ran in the Democratic presidential primary earlier this year. Yang had tweeted, \"America is 33rd in access to quality education, 33rd in child mortality and 31st in clean drinking water. But our stock market is up.\" In her Sept. 10 reply tweet, Swearengin brought home those metrics for West Virginia voters. \"West Virginia is near last in the U.S. in these rankings. There are conditions in this state comparable to a 3rd world country. Our incumbents have done nothing but line their pockets with dark money while we suffer.\" West Virginia is near last in the US in these rankings. There are conditions in this state comparable to a 3rd world country. Our incumbents have done nothing but line their pockets with dark money while we suffer. #NoMoore #WestVirginia https://t.co/Tx7XYj2M3Y We decided to check whether credible rankings show West Virginia to be \"near last in the U.S.\" in all three areas. We\u2019ll address them one by one. (Swearengin\u2019s campaign did not respond to inquiries. She eventually lost the election to Capito.) Statistics for K-12 graduation rates differ somewhat, depending on how you measure them, and as we\u2019ve reported previously, no measure is foolproof. Still, West Virginia performs well in a measure that analyzes the \"cohort\" of students entering school in a given year and then follows them to see whether they graduate, adjusting for students who move in and out of the state. By this measure, West Virginia was one of only seven states in the U.S. to reach a 90% graduation rate for the 2017-18 class. Another closely watched metric for K-12 education is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a national test of scholastic achievement at various grades. In both fourth-grade and eighth-grade math, West Virginia ranked fourth from the bottom among the 50 states in 2019. In fourth-grade reading, West Virginia was ninth from the bottom, and fourth from the bottom among eighth graders. So West Virginia has uniformly poor rankings in national standardized testing. Independent analyses suggest a broadly similar picture. An analysis by U.S. News and World Report, using these statistics and a few others, ranked West Virginia 42nd in the nation overall on K-12 education. Another analysis, by the website WalletHub, used 33 metrics to evaluate schools by state. In the metrics for educational \"quality,\" West Virginia ranked 45th nationally. The metrics we cited above on education are \"reasonable ones to use,\" said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education. The Environmental Protection Agency measures the number of violations by public water systems per 1,000 residents in 2017. West Virginia ranked 46th among the 50 states on this metric that year. The only states ranking lower were Maine, Vermont, Montana and Alaska. According to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranked fifth worst among the 50 states for child mortality in 2018. The only states with worse rates were South Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Swearengin said, \"West Virginia is near last in the U.S.\" rankings of education, clean drinking water and child mortality. In standard federal government rankings of drinking water and child mortality, West Virginia does rank in the bottom five states. It also ranked no higher than ninth from the bottom in several common math and reading tests for the National Assessment of Educational Progress. But by one measure, the state\u2019s high-school graduation rate is among the nation\u2019s best. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",

        "claim": "\u201cEvery single swing-seat House Democrat who endorsed #MedicareForAll won re-election or is on track to win re-election. Every. Single. One.\u201d",
        "doc": "Afterunexpected election losses, House Democrats have made headlines for internal divisions over how the party should appeal to voters. Moderates warnthat supporting progressive policies will lead to more members losing their seats, while progressives say the party\u2019s base should be embraced. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, said in aninterviewthat House Democrats in swing districts who supported \"Medicare for All\" won re-election, without exception. \"Every single swing-seat House Democrat who endorsed #MedicareForAll won re-election or is on track to win re-election. Every. Single. One,\" she tweeted. Every single swing-seat House Democrat who endorsed #MedicareForAll won re-election or is on track to win re-election.Every.\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd Single.\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd One.\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd Her claim gained traction on Twitter, and a reader asked us to look into it. Generally, swing seats are competitive House districts that can \"swing\" between Democratic and Republican control. Different organizations may rate different seats as competitive, but the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political analysis organization, is a highly regarded and commonly cited source. In its final Nov. 2 House race ratings, Cook listed 23 swing seats held by Democratic incumbents who were seeking re-election as \"toss up\" or \"leans Democratic.\" Of those 23, two incumbents - Reps. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania and Peter DeFazio of Oregon- co-sponsored a bill providing Medicare for All. Those two won. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, when we asked forevidence of her claim, provided a longer list of House Democrats that it said were in competitive races. Its list included Reps. Mike Levin and Katie Porter of California, Susan Wild of Pennsylvania and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, all co-sponsors of H.R. 1384, the Medicare for All Act of 2019. Levin, Porterand Wildwon seats in historically Republican districts in 2018. Kirkpatrick won in 2018 in a district that has historically swung between the parties. But the Cook Report rated Wild's seat \"likely Democratic,\" and the other seats solid Democratic. We approached the University of Virginia Center for Politics about this claim, and it sent us an analysis of 2018 races, in which political scientist Alan I. Abramowitz found support for Medicare for All was a \"vote loser\" in U.S. House races. The Ocasio-Cortez campaign also sent a list of eight members who did not co-sponsor H.R. 1384 and are in competitive districts and lost. It doesn\u2019t directly address the claim we are fact-checking here. Ocasio-Cortez said that every House Democrat in a swing seat who supports Medicare for All won their race. Ocasio-Cortez's statement is true as far as it goes, but it leaves a misleading impression. Only two of the 23 Democratic incumbents running for re-electionwhose races the Cook Political Report rated as \"toss-up\" or \"lean Democratic\" had signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. We rate her statement Mostly True.",

        "doc": "As President Donald Trump continues to spread baseless claims of widespread fraud and a \"rigged\" presidential election that left him the loser to Democrat Joe Biden, others have come to the defense of the American election system. But does that group include officials in one of Trump\u2019s own federal departments? That was the claim from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, in a Nov. 15, 2020 appearance on WISN-TV\u2019s \"UpFront\" program. \"We heard from the Department of Homeland Security this week that this was probably the most secure election that\u2019s ever been run in the United States,\" Baldwin said. Is it true that some of the nation\u2019s own top cybersecurity experts disagree with Trump? Yes. Let\u2019s take a look. On Nov. 12, 2020, officials from two Department of Homeland Security committees \u2014 the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council and the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council overseeing cybersecurity \u2014 released a joint statement debunking their own boss\u2019s rampant misinformation campaign. \"The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history,\" the statement says. It\u2019s normal for states with close contests to launch ballot recounts to allow for correction of mistakes, the statement also says, but adds there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised. \"While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,\" the statement concludes. Trump has pointedly refused to concede to Biden, and his administration has blocked typical transition measures aimed at a smooth transfer of power. And on Nov. 17, Trump fired Christopher Krebs, the senior cybersecurity official responsible for securing the presidential election. Krebs, a Trump appointee,hasbeen among the loudestvoices rebutting false claims of election fraud. In a tweet firing Krebs, Trump said Krebs' statements have been \"highly inaccurate,\" reiterating allegations of voter fraud. His unsubstantiated claims of fraud have prompted several prominent Republicans to call for investigations into election proceedings, including in Wisconsin, where the GOP-controlled Legislature will launch a probe into the election, which went to Biden by about 20,000 votes. Trump has pledged to seek a recount in Wisconsin, though the top Republican in the Assembly has acknowledged it\u2019s unlikely to change the outcome. The deadline to seek a recount \u2014 which election officials say could cost Trump\u2019s campaign nearly $8 million \u2014 is Wednesday, Nov. 18. Baldwin claimed federal security officials called the Nov. 3, 2020 election the most secure in the country\u2019s history. She\u2019s correct. The groups did so in direct conflict with what the president has been falsely claiming for weeks. We rate Baldwin\u2019s claim True.",

        "claim": "\"If you can\u2019t get a test through Test Iowa, there are multiple other sites: your doctor, your clinics, your pharmacies, the stroke detection clinic centers.\"",
        "doc": "Before announcing more stringent regulations Nov. 16, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds made a statement in a Nov. 10press conferenceabout concerns that Test Iowa \u2014 the state\u2019s COVID-19 testing program \u2014 was not conducting enough tests. This was the press conference where Reynolds announced a limited mandate requiring people to wear masks and social distance at certain gatherings. Reynolds said then Iowa can test up to 6,000 people per day with Test Iowa through the State Hygienics Lab, based in Iowa City, and listed other ways Iowans can receive a COVID-19 test: \"So, just remember though that if you can\u2019t get a test through Test Iowa, there are multiple other sites \u2014 your doctor, your clinics, your pharmacies, the stroke detection clinic centers. I mean, there are the antigen tests, you can buy a test at Costco. I mean, there are a lot of options out there and we\u2019ll continue to build that out.\" Options exist, but how accessible are they? Here are some things to know. Unlike Test Iowa, which offers free COVID-19 tests to Iowans regardless if they have infection symptoms, other options Reynolds mentioned either require people wanting a test to be deemed eligible for one or cost money, sometimes both. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends reaching out to local health-care providers to get a test, according to itswebsite. The stroke detection clinic Reynolds referred to in her statement is Health Gauge, formerly called Stroke Detection Plus, Reynolds\u2019 Communications Director Pat Garrett wrote in an email. The health and wellness business offers free COVID-19 testing to people at its Ames, Clive, and Urbandale locations in Iowa. People going to Health Gauge don\u2019t have to meet conditions such as having symptoms or having been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 to receive a test but have to pay $100, according to Health Gauge\u2019swebsite. Costco shows a COVID-19 saliva testing kit for purchase on itswebsite, available with or without video observation with a member of the Azova Patient Services Team, who manufactures the tests. Without the video option, the testing kit costs $129.99; the kit costs $139.99 with video observation. In Iowa City, tests are available at University of Iowa Health Care and Mercy Iowa City once patients have been evaluated by a health-care provider. Care providers at UI Health Care determine someone is eligible to receive a test if the person displays COVID-19 symptoms or has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. UI Health Care Public Relations Manager Laura Shoemaker wrote in an email toTheDaily Iowanthat the test may cost money but is covered by most insurance providers. Beyond health care clinics, pharmacies at stores such as Hy-Vee and Walgreens offer free COVID-19 tests by appointment. Both pharmacies require people to fill out an online survey to determine if they are eligible for tests, then have them pick a date and time.Bothpharmaciesstate on their websites that they follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines as well as state and local guidelines to determine if someone should receive a test. There are 63 Hy-Vee pharmacy locations in Iowa offering tests, but also sites in neighboring Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Walgreens lists five Iowa locations offering tests, in Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Des Moines, and Sioux City, and notes on its website that the plan is to expand testing capabilities to more locations in the coming weeks. The state operates26 Test Iowa sitesand clinics, in Black Hawk, Buena Vista, Carroll, Cass, Crawford, Des Moines, Dickinson, Dubuque, Kossuth, Mitchell, Page, Linn, Polk, Plymouth, Pottawattamie, Scott, Sioux, Story, Union, Wapello, Winneshiek, and Wright counties. ADaily Iowanreview of each location on Tuesday, Nov. 17, showed time slots available Thursday, Nov. 19, at the earliest at every location, except those in Polk and Sioux counties. On Nov. 12, two days after Reynolds made the statement, Test Iowa sites in Linn, Scott, Black Hawk, and Polk counties had no time slotsavailable. Test Iowa states on the program\u2019s questionnaire to determine whether a person qualifies for a Test Iowa test that \"over the next few days and weeks, additional testing sites in the state of Iowa will be set up.\" The CDCstatesthat people who should be tested include those with COVID-19 symptoms, who have been within 6 feet of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 for more than 15 minutes, and for whom a health-care provider, state or local health department has recommended a test. A quick check of the facts shows all of the areas Reynolds mentioned offer COVID-19 tests, though some are more accessible than others. Testing avenues such as Health Gauge and buying a test from places like Costco cost money, and organizations offering free testing might have qualifications to receive a test, and are not always in the most accessible locations for patients.

        "claim": "The 2020 election is in \u201crecount territory\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve seen elections change as a result of\u201d recounts.",
        "doc": "Recounts are the topic de jour in Wisconsin, where the official canvass shows President Donald Trump lost the state by a more than 20,000-vote margin out of more than 3.2 million ballots. We learned Nov. 18, 2020 that Trump will seek a partial recount, focused on the state\u2019s two largest (and Democrat-leaning) counties, though the chances of flipping the outcome is considered a longshot at best. A recount in the 2016 presidential race in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 22,000 votes added just 131 votes to Trump\u2019s margin. And a statewide recount in the 2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court race changed the margin by just 310 votes, retaining a 7,000-vote win for David Prosser. Even former Republican Gov. Scott Walker has noted on Twitter that Trump is unlikely to see a recount change the outcome. Meanwhile, Meagan Wolfe, director of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, has said her agency had \"not received any report of any irregularities\" \u2014 despite repeated claims to the contrary from Trump and his team, made without evidence. Nevertheless, some Republicans have pushed forward on the idea of a statewide recount, including U.S. House Representative-elect Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. Speaking before the completion of the statewide canvass that confirmed the 20,000-vote margin, Fitzgerald said Nov. 8, 2020, on WISN-TV\u2019s UpFront program it appeared the state was in \"recount territory.\" Then he said this about recounts: \"That is a very back-and-forth type of process in which arguments are made as to whether or not to keep a ballot, or throw a ballot out, and I\u2019ve seen elections change as a result of those. I know some say that\u2019s a high margin to really change but, you know, it can happen.\" Have recounts really flipped Wisconsin elections? Yes. But not any statewide races or ones with the margin of difference seen here. Fitzgerald, the current state Senate majority leader, did not respond to repeated requests from PolitiFact Wisconsin to provide evidence for his claim. So we checked with experts and news archives to see what we could find. Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said to his knowledge no statewide race in Wisconsin has ever flipped due to a recount. Since 2000, only three statewide races have flipped anywhere in the United States, according to a 2020 Survey and Analysis of Statewide Election Recount from FairVote, which advocates for ranked choice voting. They were a 2004 governor\u2019s race in Washington, a 2006 auditor\u2019s race in Vermont and a 2008 U.S. Senate seat race in Minnesota. All had initial margins of less than 300 votes. The FairVote study found the average statewide recount shifted results by 430 votes between the frontrunners, representing 0.024% of the vote in those elections. But results have shifted in local races on multiple occasions in Wisconsin given the smaller vote totals involved. A few we came across in our research: In a 1996 race for Appleton mayor, a recount flipped the race from an eight-vote loss to a 14-vote win for the challenger. In an April 2009 race for chairman in the Town of Wausau, a challenger had defeated an incumbent by a card draw after a tied vote, but a recount yielded one extra vote in favor of the incumbent. In 1997, the former town chair of the Town of Fayette in Lafayette County ran as a write-in and won by a single vote in the initial count, but after a recount he lost by two. Other recounts have broken or created ties, including a 2004 mayoral election in South Milwaukee that initially ended in a tie, but showed a one-vote margin upon a recount. And an April 2011 Oshkosh Common Council election showed a 14-vote victory, but a recount ended in a tie, forcing the candidates to draw cards to determine the victor. Recounts are conducted by the County Board of Canvassers, made up of a county clerk and two other electors appointed by the clerk, one from each party. A candidate who lost a race but was within 1% of the winner\u2019s total can request a recount. For races with at least 4,000 votes, the candidate must pay for the recount unless the margin is less than 0.25%. In those tightest races the municipality bears the cost. The board of canvassers decides whether to hand-count votes or use a machine tabulator. Magney said there can be a \"back and forth\" at a recount, in line with Fitzgerald\u2019s claim. \"If there is an objection to the counting of a particular ballot, there could be a situation where arguments are made on both sides that the recount board of canvassers hears, it is documented in the minutes, the board of canvassers makes a determination, the decision is noted, and they move on,\" Magney wrote in an email. \"The issue is preserved for any potential legal challenge to a decision made by the recount board of canvassers.\" Under state law, board members might discuss votes if a petitioner for a recount believes an error has been made (9.01(1)(b)9), if they need to determine voter intent (9.01(1)(b)8s), or if the person demanding a recount object to the counting of a ballot in a recount (9.01(1)(b)11). Amid discussions of a potential presidential recount in Wisconsin, Fitzgerald said Wisocnsin appeared to be in \"recount territory\" and \"I\u2019ve seen elections change as a result of\" recounts. Some local races have indeed flipped, which lines up with Fitzgerald\u2019s claim. But he made this comment in the context of a potential recount affecting the presidential race, and no races of that magnitude or vote-gap have flipped in Wisconsin. Nationwide, a total of three statewide races flipped in a recount between 2000 and 2020, but none had margins anywhere near the 20,000 we see in Wisconsin. So races have flipped, but not races like this. We define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.",

        "claim": "Unemployment report shows \u201cAmerica is bouncing back.\u201d",
        "doc": "In 2020, it\u2019s hard to find good news. But according to Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri, the economy is looking up. Hartzler, the 4th District representative, posted on Twitter about the latest Department of Labor report on Nov. 6. \"Great October jobs report! @USDOL reports 638,000 new jobs last month, beating the 530,000 economists expected. Unemployment rate falls to 6.9%, also beating expectations,\" Hartzler wrote. \"Labor force participation rate rose 0.3 points to 61.7%. America is bouncing back!\" According to Department of Labor data, Hartzler\u2019s data is correct. But we wondered whether the numbers mean the U.S. is \"bouncing back\" from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. We tried to contact Hartzler but received no response. So, we decided to talk to economics experts to see if Hartzler is right. According to a news release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate in February 2020 was under 4%. In April, as the COVID-19 virus spread, it skyrocketed to over 14%. Since then, the unemployment rate has been steadily declining. As of the October report, it was around 7%. Though we are still not back to where we were in February, MU economics professor Alina Malkova says the economy looks good. She says the current recession is different from the recessions we have seen before, like in 2008. \"We can predict that we will recover quickly,\" Malkova said. In 2008, people were running out of money or going into debt. That recession took years to recover from. In early 2020, people had money, but they couldn\u2019t spend it because of business closures and shut-downs. \"And when the economy started to open again,\" Malkova said, \"they started to spend money very quickly.\" This results in what economists call a \"V curve\" or a \"V-shaped recovery.\" This occurs when economic recovery creates a V-shaped curve on a graph, signaling an economy is bouncing back. The graph is not currently a full \"V\", and experts say we still have months to go. In comparison to the 2008 recession though, MU economics and public affairs professor Peter Mueser says this is a quick recovery. Mueser says there are some things we should keep an eye on though, such as people who have been unemployed long term. \"In fact, there are more long term unemployed people,\" Mueser said. \"There's a substantial number of people who are sort of waiting for jobs. But nonetheless, you can't say that the statistics don't look encouraging.\" According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, temporary unemployment fell by 1.4 million from September to October. Long term unemployment actually increased by about 1.2 million in that same time period. Long term unemployment is defined as someone who is jobless for 27 weeks or more. For context, in February 2020, over 1.1 million people were unemployed long term. In October, there were about 3.6 million people unemployed long term. If COVID-19 cases continue to increase and businesses shut down, we could see another increase in unemployment. But, Malkova said similar dynamics for a recovery should apply, too. Citing new jobs numbers, Hartzler said that \"America is bouncing back.\" The unemployment rate, which had risen by more than 10 points from February to April, is steadily falling again. However, there is other jobs data that shows reason for continued concern about the state of the economy. For example, the number of people with long term unemployment actually grew by about 1.2 million from September to October. Because Hartzler\u2019s claim was accurate but left out some details, we rate her claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "The law governing the transition of presidential power \u201cdoesn\u2019t require there to be an absolute winner. It says the \u2018apparent' winner.\u201d",
        "doc": "Eager to embark on the nitty-gritty processes of an administrative transition, President-elect Joe Biden complained about how one federal agency was dragging its feet. In a Nov. 17 discussion with health care workers in Wilmington, Del., Biden criticized the General Services Administration, the low-profile federal agency tasked by law to formally initiate the transition process. \"The law says that the General Services Administration has a person who recognizes who the winner is,\" Biden said during the roundtable. \"And then they have to have access to all the data and information that the government possesses to be prepared. And it doesn\u2019t require there to be an absolute winner. It says the \u2018apparent winner.\u2019 The apparent winner. And we\u2019ve been unable to get access to the kinds of things we need to know about.\" Biden said the agency\u2019s inaction means that his transition team has been prevented from obtaining key information from the Trump administration \u2014 specifically related to any plans for distributing coronavirus vaccines to more than 300 million Americans. Is Biden correct about the legal standard for the General Services Administration to initiate the transition process? Biden is correctly describing the language used in the law: To kick off the formal transition process, the agency administrator needs to determine whether there\u2019s an \"apparent\" winner, rather than an \"absolute\" winner. Biden\u2019s is \"a reasonable statement\" describing the current situation, said Terry Sullivan, a professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in the presidency. That said, experts acknowledge that the law is vague enough that the administrator has some leeway in making the \"ascertainment\" decision. The primary law governing transitions, the Presidential Transition Act, took effect in 1964. It has been updated on several occasions, including laws enacted in 2010, 2016, and 2020. The law says, \"The terms \u2018President-elect\u2019 and \u2018Vice-President-elect\u2019 as used in this Act shall mean such persons as are the apparent successful candidates for the office of President and Vice President, respectively, as ascertained by the Administrator following the general elections held to determine the electors of President and Vice President.\" This language triggers the \"expectation that the administrator of the General Services Administration will make a common-sense decision about the election outcome,\" said Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University\u2019s Robert Wagner School of Public Service. Once that decision is made, the legal basis for \"the infrastructure of support\" for a presidential transition is in place, Light said. The president-elect and his team have approximately 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day to organize the new administration, and prepare to assume national security and homeland security responsibilities from the incumbent, among other tasks, according to a Nov. 13 Congressional Research Service report. In general, presidential transition activities are coordinated by the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget. Once the president-elect and vice president-elect have been \"ascertained\" by the GSA, federal officials are allowed to provide the transition team with facilities, funds, and services to prepare for the new administration. The money can be spent on salaries, consultants, office supplies, travel expenses and government aircraft. The agency\u2019s current administrator, Emily Murphy, has not signed the required ascertainment document yet. \"The administrator is striving to adhere to the language and intent of the law, as well as precedent,\" GSA spokeswoman Pamela Pennington told PolitiFact. \"Please note that the law provides no process or standard by which ascertainment is made.\" Prior to Trump, departing presidents have generally adhered to the tradition of a smooth and straightforward transition. The laws governing the transition have enshrined the idea that the outgoing administration \"had a responsibility to hand off matters in a considered and organized fashion,\" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that runs a Center for Presidential Transition that advises on best practices. RELATED: How we know Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential race Light pointed to a statement by then-GSA Administrator David J. Barram in testimony before Congress in December 2000, at a time when the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore was so close that it had to effectively be decided by the Supreme Court. \"While the Act gives no explicit criteria or deadlines for making this ascertainment, as the legislative history demonstrates, Congress made it perfectly clear that if there is \u2018any question\u2019 of who the winner is \u2018in a close contest,\u2019 this determination should not be made,\" Barram testified at the time. In an interview this week on CNN, Barram said the situation now is \"dramatically different\" than what he faced in 2000. \"To me, it's clear that we should be recognizing Joe Biden as the president-elect,\" he said on Nov. 19. The fuzziness in the law has meant that the ascertainment has traditionally been viewed \"as pro forma,\" Stier said. \"The expectation was that it was important and should be done without having to demonstrate an extraordinary level of proof.\" The absence of a clear concession and Trump\u2019s continuing efforts to fight the election results are the primary reason why the Trump-to-Biden transition has been so rocky, experts said. \"For 220 years, our country has had a peaceful transition of power,\" said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied transition issues. Trump has not only refused to concede, but he has \"perpetuated the myth that the election was somehow fraudulent,\" she said. Stier argues that, even in the absence of a formal ascertainment, the Trump administration could voluntarily start doing some things to help the incoming administration get ready, such as sharing intelligence, encouraging meetings with public health officials, and allowing security-clearance investigations to begin. \"This is not about some abstract decision that GSA has to make \u2014 it\u2019s about choices being made to pursue a policy of noncooperation,\" Stier said. Light lays the blame on Trump, not on Murphy, who he says is required to answer to a vague law. \"Everything here hinges on good faith,\" Light said. \"The GSA administrator may have been well within the boundaries of the statute to deny a formal launch decision, but Trump's interference and threats have poisoned the cooperative relationship that has long marked the process, even after bitter campaigns such as 1980, when Reagan bested Carter for the presidency.\" RELATED: How narrow was Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Donald Trump? Biden said the law governing the transition of presidential power \"doesn\u2019t require there to be an absolute winner. It says the \u2018apparent winner.\u2019\" Biden has accurately phrased the language of the law, but the law is vague enough that it allows some leeway in making an \"ascertainment\" decision. It\u2019s worth noting that the Trump administration has impeded a smooth transition in spite of the letter of the law, by challenging election results in courts. We rate the statement Mostly True.

        "claim": "Says there\u2019s \u201cup to 75% reduction in opioid dosage for medical cannabis users.\u201d",
        "doc": "State lawmakers so far have filed more than a dozen bills related to marijuana and medical cannabis for consideration during the 2021 legislative session, coming on the heels of a record-breaking 65 marijuana bills filed last legislative session. Proponents of loosening the state\u2019s marijuana prohibitions hope that momentum generated by legalization efforts around the country could carry into Texas, riding on arguments that legalization would be a boon for the economy and an important pillar of criminal justice reform. Rep. Lyle Larson, R-San Antonio, made a different case for medical marijuana when he filed House Joint Resolution 28. In an announcement on Twitter, Larson said the bill would allow voters to decide \"whether Texas physicians should be allowed to prescribe medical cannabis for a variety of illnesses plaguing Texans.\" If approved by more than two-thirds of both legislative chambers, a proposal would be added to the November 2021 ballot that would amend the state constitution to legalize the possession, cultivation and sale of cannabis strictly for medical use. Larson cited one statistic to justify his bill: \"Studies have shown up to 75% reduction in opioid dosage for medical cannabis users\" The intersection of medical cannabis and opioid use as treatments for chronic pain is an emerging field of research as more states loosen regulations on medical and recreational use of marijuana. But does science show that cannabis has as great an impact on opioid dosage as Larson claims? Larson\u2019s aides pointed to a report published over the summer by researchers at the University of Arizona that assessed the effectiveness of medical cannabis in reducing opioid dosage for the treatment of chronic pain in non-cancer patients. The analysis looked at nine separate studies involving a total of 7,222 participants across the U.S., Canada and Australia that \"found a much higher reduction in opioid dosage, reduced emergency room visits, and hospital admissions for chronic non-cancer pain by (medical cannabis) users, compared to people with no additional use of\" medical cannabis. Those studies confirm Larson\u2019s assertion: There was a 64% to 75% reduction in opioid dosage when patients supplemented their chronic pain treatments with medical cannabis, and 32% to 59% of cannabis users reported a complete end to opioid use. But University of Arizona researchers note several caveats to these findings. There has generally been \"a dearth of empirical studies\" about the use of cannabis versus opioids in chronic pain treatments. In order to include a large sample size, the researchers \"relaxed inclusion criteria\" in their analysis to allow for the inclusion of observational studies, which are not systematic enough to be considered empirical evidence. For instance, in each of the nine studies, patients were self-reporting their reduction of opioid dosage, implying a degree of uncertainty in the findings. And in several of the studies, patients didn\u2019t report the amount of cannabis used to achieve a reduction of opioid dosage. Furthermore, researchers noted how cannabis can slow a person\u2019s metabolism, thereby causing an opioid medication to absorb into their bloodstream more slowly. This effect can give a patient the impression that their opioid dosage may need to be increased. While studies suggest that cannabis could be used to reduce opioid dosages when treating chronic pain, researchers suggest the findings be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the evidence. The intent of the study is to suggest to the wider medical field that more systematic tests should be conducted, said Dr. Babasola Okusanya of the University of Arizona, who was involved in the study, and the severity of the opioid epidemic should heighten the urgency of these tests. \"Given the current opioid epidemic in the USA and medical cannabis\u2019s recognized analgesic properties, (medical cannabis) could serve as a viable option to achieve opioid dosage reduction in managing non-cancer chronic pain,\" researchers wrote. \"Unfortunately, the evidence from this review cannot be relied upon to promote (medical cannabis) as an adjunct to opioids in treating non-cancer chronic pain.\" It would be premature to base legislation on this study\u2019s findings, Okusanya said. \"Although some evidence points to the potential use of medical cannabis for opioid dose reduction in people with non-cancer chronic pain, it is not sufficient to support a legislative bill to make medical cannabis available to people with non-cancer chronic pain,\" he said. While the effects of cannabis on decreasing opioid usage may be inconclusive, other studies have shown that increasing access to marijuana can lead to a reduction in opioid-related deaths. Last year, researchers found that the legalization of recreational marijuana reduced annual opioid mortality between 20% and 35%. \"Recreational marijuana laws affect a much larger population than medical marijuana laws, yet we know relatively little about their effects,\"said Nathan Chan of University of Massachusetts Amherst, who co-authored the study. \"Focusing on the recent wave of recreational marijuana laws in the U.S., we find that opioid mortality rates drop when recreational marijuana becomes widely available via dispensaries.\" The Legislature first cracked open the door to medical cannabis in 2015 by creating the Texas Compassionate Use Program. The program limited medical cannabis to low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and could only be used in the treatment of intractable epilepsy. In 2019, the Legislature expanded the program to allow physicians to prescribe medical cannabis to treat several other conditions, including all types of epilepsy, terminal cancer, autism, multiple sclerosis and other neuro-degenerative disorders. Other conditions that medical cannabis advocates pushed for that did not get included in the 2019 expansion include chronic pain and post traumatic stress disorder. During the 2021 session, advocates say they will push to include these conditions under the program and will seek to eliminate restrictions on THC levels in medical cannabis. Currently, state law caps THC in medical cannabis at 0.5% \u2014 a level that advocates say is arbitrary. \"Many patients benefit from THC, and it's our position that doctors should be the ones who are making the decision about dosing rather than lawmakers,\" said Heather Fazio, director of the Marijuana Policy Project. \"We trust doctors with far more dangerous drugs.\" Larson\u2019s legislative director Caroline Cone echoed that argument. \"Currently, (medical professionals) can't prescribe it, but they can prescribe opioids which have proven to be much more addictive and damaging long term,\" Cone said. \"Anxiety and pain management for veterans and elderly folks in lieu of opioids was Rep. Larson's motivation to file the legislation.\" Larson filed legislation earlier this month aimed at expanding the use of medical cannabis by giving physicians the authority to prescribe cannabis based on their own expertise. In a tweet, Larson justified his bill by saying that medical cannabis can help chronic pain patients reduce opioid dosage by up to 75%. Preliminary studies suggest a correlation between medical cannabis usage and a reduction in opioid dosage, but researchers note the results are inconclusive and more rigorous testing should be done to know the full effects of medical cannabis on opioid dosage.

        "claim": "Says Kelly Loeffler is \"for getting rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic.\"",
        "doc": "Attacks are going extreme in the two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat who is challenging Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, was accused by a conservative pundit of running over his wife and having been arrested for obstructing a child abuse investigation. We rated the claim, misleading on both counts, Mostly False. In a lighter response, Warnock used a TV ad to poke fun at attacks on him. \"Raphael Warnock eats pizza with a fork and knife, Raphael Warnock once stepped on a crack in the sidewalk, Raphael Warnock even hates puppies,\" the narrator says, before Warnock makes an attack of his own. \"Get ready, Georgia, the negative ads are coming,\" a smiling Warnock says. \"Kelly Loeffler doesn\u2019t want to talk about why she\u2019s for getting rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic, so she\u2019s going to try and scare you with lies about me.\" He\u2019s made the health care attack repeatedly. This claim exaggerates, but has some truth to it. To back Warnock\u2019s attack, his campaign cited Loeffler\u2019s Oct. 1 vote to allow the Trump administration to proceed with its support of a lawsuit that aims to overturn the Affordable Care Act. (The specific measure would have blocked the Justice Department from pursuing the lawsuit; Loeffler voted against it.) Overturning Obamacare would eliminate the law\u2019s protections for millions of people with pre-existing conditions. The protections include preventing insurance companies from excluding those people from coverage and limiting the premiums that can be charged to older people. RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs While it\u2019s possible the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the lawsuit Nov. 10, could strike down the entire law, law experts say that\u2019s not the most likely outcome. Still, the lawsuit\u2019s aim is to repeal the law entirely. Warnock\u2019s campaign also argues that the lawsuit would eliminate health care coverage for millions of people who are insured through marketplaces set up by Obamacare or through the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. The New York Times reported that if Obamacare is struck down, 21 million people are at serious risk of becoming uninsured. In addition, Warnock\u2019s campaign cites Loeffler\u2019s support for two measures that would provide health coverage options that it criticizes, arguing that they would result in a loss of health care. Loeffler supports allowing for more short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans, which she says gives consumers more options. Those plans are exempt from Obamacare\u2019s protections for pre-existing conditions, however. Loeffler also backed a controversial Medicaid waiver, sought by Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and approved by the federal government. Kemp contends the waiver will help residents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies on the federal marketplace. But some 400,000 Georgians who bought individual health insurance plans on the federal healthcare.gov Affordable Care Act shopping website will instead have to work through private brokers or insurance companies., Critics say 60,000 Georgians could be left without health insurance. Railing against what she calls the left\u2019s efforts to turn health care into a government-run system, Loeffler on Nov. 13 released a health care plan that she says will protect people with pre-existing conditions while offering them more options. It includes the short-term plans and the Medicaid waiver. It does not include the same robust protections that the federal Affordable Care Act has. Warnock said Loeffler is \"for getting rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic.\" That\u2019s an overly broad statement that could be interpreted any number of ways. The facts are that Loeffler voted to let the Trump administration continue supporting a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Millions of people could lose health care if the Supreme Court throws out the law. Loeffler supports offering health care alternatives, but critics say they are not as good as Obamacare\u2019s provisions. Warnock\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Our rating is Half True.

        "claim": "When Donald Trump lost the Iowa caucus to Ted Cruz in 2016, \"he immediately cried that Cruz cheated.\u201d",
        "doc": "President Donald Trump telegraphed thathe\u2019d claim voter fraudin the November election and carried through withtweetsabout his unfounded claims of fake votes while simultaneously filing election-related lawsuits. Republicans came to Trump\u2019s aid. They included Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, whodefeated Trumpin Iowa\u2019s 2016 first-in-the-nation presidential precinct caucuses when Cruz also sought his party\u2019s nomination to be president. \"I believe President Trump still has a path to victory, and that path is to count every single legal vote that was cast, but also not to [count] any votes that were fraudulently cast or illegally cast. And we have a legal process to determine what\u2019s legal and what isn\u2019t,\" Cruz said in a Nov. 8 Fox Newsinterviewon the Sunday Morning Futures program. On Nov. 11, Cruztold conservative commentator Steven Crowderthat overturning the election required Trump\u2019s legal team to run the table in its court challenges to voting in several states: \"I\u2019ve talked with President Trump and with Jared Kushner and with the White House. What I\u2019ve told them is they need serious lawyers to present evidence at this point. It can\u2019t be won or lost in the world of social media, it\u2019s got to be facts and evidence in court. And by the way, you can do it.\" After Cruz\u2019s comments, some Twitter users noted on the social media platform that they had heard about voter fraud before \u2014 after Iowa\u2019s 2016 caucuses. \"Trump is playing you. Before the election even started he admitted he was going to claim fraud if he lost. When he lost the Iowa caucus to Ted Cruz in 2016 he immediately cried that Cruz cheated,\" said one Another said, \"Trump has a history of claiming \u2018fraud\u2019 whenever he loses. Remember the Iowa Caucuses from 2016 with Ted Cruz?\" Rachel Maddow, of MSNBC,quoteda storyby colleague Steve Benen:\"Four years ago yesterday, one GOP presidential hopeful \u2013 I believe his name was Donald J. Trump \u2013 tweeted, \u2018Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified\u2019.\" A look at Twitter confirms Trump\u2019s post-Iowa tweets from 2016. Trump tweeted several times on Feb. 3, 2016, about Cruz\u2019s win in a caucus system that collects presidential preference votes from Republicans who caucus but no formal, binding vote. In one post-caucuses tweet,Trump wrote, \"Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.\" Inanother: \"Cruz did not win Iowa, he stole it.\" The tweets came two days after the caucuses andafter Trump\u2019s concession speechIn Iowa. \"We finished second,\" he said in that speech. \"And I want to tell you something, I\u2019m just honored. I\u2019m really honored. And I want to congratulate Ted [Cruz].\" Following Trump\u2019s comments that the caucuses were fraudulent, Cruz took to Twitter, calling Trump\u2019s reaction\"yet another #Trumpertantrum.\" When Cruz was asked in 2016 about his comments in a Goffstown, New Hampshire, news conferenceCruz saidTrump was a person who \"finds it very hard to lose.\" When Trump loses, \"he blames everybody else. It\u2019s never Donald\u2019s fault,\" Cruz said, according toThe New York Timesstory from the news conference. The Des Moines Registerreportedthat former Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn called Trump\u2019s claims of voter fraud \"an absurd allegation.\" A 2019 book, \"American Carnage: On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War and the Rise of President Trump,\" reported that Trump urged Republican Party of Iowa chairman Jeff Kaufmann to invalidate the results of the 2016 caucuses. Trump abandoned his efforts in Iowa as he went on to win other state primaries and eventually the nomination. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, whose office did not have a role in the party-run caucus preference poll, said Iowa Republicans would not invalidate the 2016 caucus results for any reason when asked in a 2019 interview. \"Iowa has got a good reputation,\"Pate saidon the Iowa PBS program, Iowa Press, in July 2019. \"I have confidence that we\u2019ll keep our integrity there, and we\u2019ll make sure our caucuses are run on the up and up.\" Twitter users said President Trump claimed the Iowa caucuses in 2016 were fraudulent. Trump tweeted a handful of times on Feb. 3, 2016 about Ted Cruz stealing the election and the votes being fraudulent. We rate the Twitter users\u2019 claims to be True.",

        "claim": "\"Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting.\"",
        "doc": "Out of jail for the first time since August, Kyle Rittenhouse is garnering a new wave of attention. The 17-year-old from Antioch, Ill., had been held on a $2 million bond on charges he shot three people \u2014 killing two \u2014 during the Kenosha unrest that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake. In that time the Illinois teen has become something of a conservative celebrity, generating millions of dollars for his release and the ongoing legal case where his lawyers will argue he acted in self defense. Rittenhouse was released from custody Nov. 20, 2020, but we learned an array of new details the day before in a jailhouse interview with the Washington Post \u2014 including how he came by the gun used in the shooting. One widely shared Instagram post honed in on that detail Nov. 20, saying, \"Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting.\" Did the gun used in the streets of Kenosha really come from a federally-funded stimulus? The balleralert Instagram account that posted the claim cited the Washington Post as its source, and that is largely what the paper reported. The Nov. 19 story reads in part, \"The Post found that Rittenhouse, who was too young to buy a rifle, had arranged for an adult friend to buy the weapon for him using money Rittenhouse had received from a government stimulus program.\" That friend, 19-year-old Dominick Black of Burlington, Wis., purchased the weapon for him at an Ace Hardware store in Ladysmith, Wis., on May 1, 2020, according to a criminal complaint charging Black with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to someone under 18, resulting in death. The gun was then stored at Black\u2019s stepfather\u2019s house in Kenosha, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Here\u2019s how Rittenhouse described the purchase to the Post. \"I got my $1,200 from the coronavirus Illinois unemployment because I was on furlough from YMCA,\" he said. \"And I got my first unemployment check so I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll use this to buy it.\u2019\" This is where the matter gets a bit muddled. The Post reported generally that stimulus funds were used, while the Instagram post made a more specific reference to \"stimulus checks,\" which would reference the payments of $1,200 per person. And Rittenhouse appears to confuse the two in his statement. The stimulus checks approved by Congress in March were indeed for $1,200, but those are different from unemployment. Stimulus payments went to all adults under certain income limits, while unemployment benefits are paid only to those out of work \u2014 as Rittenhouse was, based on his furlough description. Rittenhouse told the Post he lived with his mother, a circumstance that would typically mean she claims him as a dependent on her taxes. That would make him ineligible for the $1,200 stimulus payment. Instead, it appears Rittenhouse was referencing several weeks of unemployment compensation approved through the CARES Act, said Washington Post Investigations Editor Jeff Leen. He said Rittenhouse\u2019s mother later told the paper that money for the gun came from \"special unemployment\" related to the pandemic. Rittenhouse had noted he was off work, and the act signed into law March 27 provided an extra $600 per week in unemployment through the end of July. Rittenhouse\u2019s attorneys did not return a phone call or email seeking clarification. An Instagram post says \"Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting.\" We don\u2019t have bank records or documents to concretely prove this, leaving us to take Rittenhouse at his word on the source of the funds. Rittenhouse did tell the Post he used $1,200 in coronavirus funds, buthe appears to confuse stimulus and unemployment payments. It\u2019s more likely Rittenhouse was referring to unemployment than the stimulus program itself, based on his life circumstances and description from him and his mother. That is indeed a \"COVID-19 stimulus,\" but not the one people would think of based on this post\u2019s description. We rate this claim Half True.",

        "claim": "Says \"David Schweikert took over $120,000 from the drug industry and voted against legislation to lower prescription drug prices.\"",
        "doc": "Handicappers rate the House race in Arizona\u2019s 6th Congressional District as a toss-up, with the edge going to the Republican incumbent, David Schweikert. The high cost of prescription drugs resonates in retiree-heavy Arizona and a major union backing Democrat Hiral Tipirneni in the race has taken Schweikert to task for his voting record on the issue. \"David Schweikert took over $120,000 from the drug industry and voted against legislation to lower prescription drug prices,\" an Oct. 7 Facebook ad from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said. Schweikert did get that much money from the pharmaceutical sector in his time in office. And he did vote against a major Democratic bill that outside analysts said would push down drug prices. On the other hand, Schweikert backed a Republican bill that would have insulated millions of Medicare recipients from out-of-pocket costs, without doing as much to drive down drug prices. In this fact-check, we look at how both bills tackled rising prices, and whether protecting some patients from higher costs is the same as reining in underlying prices themselves. We made several efforts to connect with Schweikert\u2019s staff and did not hear back. According to the Center of Responsive Politics, since 2011, Schweikert received $124,902 from the pharmaceutical/health supply sector. His support grew from a low of $10,100 in the 2014 election cycle, to $39,102 in the current one. The industry went from being Schweikert\u2019s 26th largest donor in 2012, to being his eighth largest today. In December 2019, the House passed the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act on a largely party line vote. (No Democrats voted against the bill and only two Republicans voted for it.) Under the bill\u2019s most sweeping element, the government would negotiate with drug companies on the prices of as many as 250 drugs. Those prices wouldn\u2019t simply apply to government insurance programs like Medicare. Private insurers could use them, too. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that in the course of 10 years, this would reduce government spending by $456 billion. The CBO left no uncertainty over the bill\u2019s impact. \"The lower prices under the bill would immediately lower current and expected future revenues for drug manufacturers, change manufacturers\u2019 incentives, and have broad effects on the drug market,\" the CBO told Congress. The CBO also estimated that the revenue reductions would have an impact on the drug industry. Overall, it would stand in the way of between eight and 15 new drugs coming to market over the decade. The drug industry\u2019s leading trade group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, vigorously opposed the Democratic bill, warning of \"devastating\" effects on drug innovation and jobs in the pharmaceutical sector. The bill also pressured drug makers to reduce prices on many drugs covered by Medicare. If the price of a drug had gone up faster than inflation, the company could either cut the price, or pay a rebate to Washington. The Republican bill \u2014 the Lower Costs, More Cures Act \u2014 did not include either of those two Democratic elements. But the two parties found something approaching common ground on the topic of capping out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients, although the levels of the caps differed. The Republicans capped out-of-pocket costs at $3,100, and the Democrats capped them lower, at $2,000. There were a number of other elements in both bills, but these three pieces capture the bulk of the moves that would directly affect what people pay for prescription drugs. Here\u2019s a summary: Schweikert voted against the Democratic bill, and was one of 147 co-sponsors of the Republican bill. From the point of view of anyone on Medicare facing the high cost of prescription drugs, a cap on out-of-pocket costs would deliver welcome relief. Both the Republican and Democratic proposals would help millions of people. Both bills would insulate Medicare recipients from the highest costs, said University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill health care policy professor Jonathan Oberlander, but it\u2019s reach is limited. \"A cap can of course provide meaningful help to those who spend large amounts on medications,\" Oberlander said. \"But it doesn\u2019t help those subject to high prices whose total spending is still under the cap.\" Georgetown University professor Jack Hoadly said, \"Help with out-of-pocket costs does not address drug prices.\" \"It simply transfers more of the cost to either the government or the drug plan,\" Hoadly said. \"Eventually those costs will come back to beneficiaries in higher premiums.\" The Republican bill did include some elements that indirectly could keep prices lower. It aimed to stop drug makers from abusing patent protections and blocking the entry of cheaper generic drugs. \"Over time that could have an impact on prices,\" said Washington University in St. Louis law professor Rachel Sachs. In contrast, Sachs said, the Democratic bill targeted drug prices directly with impacts that went beyond Medicare beneficiaries. \"Either through negotiating with the drug makers or discouraging them from raising prices faster than inflation, that would touch a broad cross section of Americans,\" Sachs said. The Congressional Budget Office analysis gave an idea of how much money taxpayers would save on prescription drugs under the Democratic bill. The CBO did not do a similar analysis of the Republican measure. But analyst Juliette Cubanski at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care policy data, said if the CBO had scored the Republican bill \"it would definitely have gotten a much smaller savings estimate.\" \"HR3 (the Democratic bill) included more provisions than HR19 (the Republican bill) to cap drug price increases and attempt to lower prices overall,\" Cubanski said. A Facebook ad from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said Schweikert got over $120,000 from the drug industry and voted against a bill to lower prescription drug prices. Schweikert received $124,902 from the drug and health products industry since he entered Congress. He voted against a bill that would have had a significant impact on drug prices and was projected to cut industry revenues by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. He backed a bill that would insulate millions of Medicare recipients from high out-of-pocket costs. According to multiple independent assessments, that alone would not drive down prices. Some measures in the bill could reduce some drug prices over time through competition from generic drugs. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "\u201cDonald Trump and Thom Tillis opposed legislation that would lower the price of insulin and other prescription drugs.\u201d",
        "doc": "During the first presidential debate of 2020, President Donald Trump touted his efforts to curb skyrocketing drug prices and declared that insulin is now \"so cheap, it\u2019s like water.\" The response on social media was swift, and divided, with some people sharing pharmacy bills showing thousands of dollars they\u2019d spent on insulin, while others boasted of newfound savings. The next day, a self-described progressive political action committee called Change Now jumped into the fray by releasing an ad that circulated on Facebook attacking Trump and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., on this issue. In the 30-second ad, a North Carolina woman in her 30s explains she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 4. \"Donald Trump and Thom Tillis opposed legislation that would lower the price of insulin and other prescription drugs,\" she says. \"People with diabetes can\u2019t afford to wait for Trump and Tillis to fight for us. ... We need affordable insulin now.\" (Posts sharing the quote were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. Read more about PolitiFact\u2019s partnership with Facebook.) In recent years, politicians on both sides of the aisle have committed to addressing the cost of insulin. This election cycle \u2014 coinciding with a looming threat to the Affordable Care Act and millions of people losing jobs and employer-sponsored health insurance during the pandemic \u2014 the high price of prescription drugs has gained new significance. Tillis is in one of the most heated Senate races in the country and has been repeatedly criticized by his opponent for receiving more than $400,000 in campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical and health product industries. Across the country, many voters say lowering prescription drug costs should be the top health priority for elected officials. So, did Trump and Tillis really oppose policies that would accomplish that goal? We decided to take a closer look. It turns out they\u2019ve both opposed certain pieces of legislation that could have lowered the price of insulin and other prescription drugs, but they\u2019ve also offered alternatives. The question is how aggressive those alternatives are and how many Americans would benefit from them. Change Now pointed to two congressional bills to support the ad\u2019s claim: one opposed by Trump, and the other by Tillis. The first bill, known as H.R. 3, passed the House in December 2019, largely due to Democratic votes. It contains three main elements: decreasing out-of-pocket costs for people on Medicare, penalizing pharmaceutical companies that raise the price of drugs faster than the rate of inflation and \u2014 the most aggressive and controversial feature \u2014 allowing the federal government, which administers Medicare, to negotiate the price of certain drugs, including insulin. It also requires manufacturers to offer those agreed-on prices to private insurers, extending the benefits to a wider swath of Americans. Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, called it \"the broadest-reaching policy that has been put forward\" on drug pricing. \"While a lot of reform has focused on Medicare beneficiaries, that misses many insulin users,\" Dusetzina said. \"H.R. 3 does the most to affect prices for young consumers, like the woman in the ad.\" At the time, Trump vowed to veto that bill, saying the price controls it imposed \"would likely undermine access to lifesaving medications\" by decreasing the incentive for companies to innovate. When we checked in with the Trump campaign about the ad, a spokesperson reiterated this position, adding that the president continues to seek better legislative options. The House bill in question, though, never made it to the president\u2019s desk because the Senate didn\u2019t take it up. Instead, the Senate Finance Committee proposed its own bill, which brings us to the second piece of legislation cited by Change Now. Known as the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, the Senate bill echoes two aims of the House proposal: decreasing out-of-pocket costs for people on Medicare and putting an inflation-based cap on some drug prices. That bill, too, stalled, with several Republican senators wary of the inflation cap. Among them was Tillis, who expressed concern that the measure could hamper innovation. So it\u2019s true that Trump and Tillis have both opposed legislation that could lower the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs. But that\u2019s not the full picture of what either politician has done on this issue. The Trump campaign provided a long list of actions taken by his administration to curb the high costs of medication, including a flurry of executive orders related to insulin and prescription drugs. Tillis\u2019 campaign highlighted an alternative bill the senator co-sponsored to target drug costs. Let\u2019s break them down one at a time. One of Trump\u2019s orders aims to have Federally Qualified Health Centers provide insulin and EpiPens at a discounted rate to the low-income individuals they serve. These centers, however, are already required to offer sliding-scale payments, and a full discount to patients who earn below the federal poverty line, said Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, who tracks drug-pricing laws. Another order deals with the importation of drugs from Canada, where they are often cheaper. Although the order specifically excludes biologic drugs, including insulin, the administration has requested proposals from private companies on how insulin could be safely brought in from other countries. The president also issued a particularly ambitious order that seeks to tie the price Medicare pays for drugs to a lower international reference price. The Trump administration, however, hasn\u2019t released final regulations to implement that policy, which could take years. If implemented, the policy is expected to be challenged in court by the drug industry. Perhaps the most notable measure on insulin at the moment, experts said, is a federal demonstration project that Medicare plans can voluntarily opt into, to cap the monthly copay for insulin at $35 for some seniors. The project is slated to begin in January 2021, but its long-term future is uncertain, Sachs said, because it relies on parts of the Affordable Care Act, which could be struck down by a Supreme Court ruling later this year. In Congress, Tillis and five other Republican senators introduced an alternative drug-pricing bill last December, called the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. Tillis believes this is \"the better option,\" campaign spokesperson Andrew Romeo said, because \"in addition to helping control drug prices, the legislation also seeks to preserve America's capacity to research and develop lifesaving medications.\" It includes a monthly cap on insulin copays for Medicare beneficiaries and requires manufacturers to disclose prices in consumer ads. But experts said Tillis\u2019 proposal is weaker than other options before the House and Senate. It doesn\u2019t include an inflation cap, Sachs said, and the bill\u2019s benefit would likely be limited to some seniors on Medicare, leaving out the more than 150 million Americans covered by private insurance. Jason Roberts, an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said the bill is largely symbolic. \"Tillis is getting hit for not supporting a bill that could move,\" Roberts said. \"Instead, he introduces something that has no chance of going anywhere, and he knows that. But it\u2019s a way of trying to deflect that criticism without getting a lot accomplished.\" An ad sponsored by a progressive political action committee claims that Trump and Tillis have opposed legislation that would decrease the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs. Based on the two pieces of drug-pricing legislation Change Now points to, that\u2019s accurate. Trump and Tillis have voiced opposition to prominent bills that experts say could decrease the cost of insulin for a broad group of Americans. Both politicians have proposed alternative policies to lower the price of insulin and other prescription drugs, but most of their proposals have not taken effect yet and are largely targeted at seniors.

        "doc": "The re-election campaign of U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., created a website for attacking his opponent, Republican state Rep. Nancy Mace. \"Nancy Mace denies climate change\" is one of Cunningham\u2019s claims on MaceFacts.com. In statements made since September, Mace has not always ruled out the impact of human beings, but she has consistently resisted an embrace of climate change. Several times, she has suggested the science is inconclusive. The race pitting Mace, a state representative since 2018, against first-time House member Cunningham is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. The Cook Political Report rates the match-up as \"lean Democratic,\" meaning the race is competitive but Cunningham has an advantage. According to NASA, the Earth\u2019s climate has changed throughout history. But \"the current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely \u2014 greater than 95% probability \u2014 to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.\" Evidence for the \"rapid climate change\" includes a global temperature rise, warming of the oceans and shrinking ice sheets. Here\u2019s a look at six sets of statements Mace has made, focusing on instances where she has spoken at some length. At a Sept. 3 event sponsored by the Post and Courier, a newspaper in Charleston, a reporter who said he was posing a question from a reader asked Mace if she believes in climate change. Mace began her answer by saying: \"I\u2019m kind of mixed on this. I\u2019m not a scientist, and I\u2019ve read science on both sides of this issue. To me, it\u2019s not clear cut. I know that here in downtown Charleston, we\u2019re seeing rising sea levels. And that could be a product of the climate, but that\u2019s also partially a product of the peninsula being largely built on landfill in many places.\" When the reporter followed up by asking Mace what she\u2019s not sure about, Mace said: \"So, if you look at the history of Earth, we\u2019ve had climate changes many times, over 130 times over millions of years. And so part of it might be man-made; part of it might be just natural environmental causes as part of the cycle of Earth.\" She added: \"I think it\u2019s more complicated than people really realize. You can\u2019t say one or the other when there\u2019s data on both sides of the issue. And I read about scientists that have flipped from one side to the other \u2014 both ways \u2014 so it\u2019s hard to understand and know which one is right.\" The Washington Examiner reported Sept. 11 that it asked Mace to clarify her position on climate change. Mace replied, according to the newspaper, that \"she is \u2018not a scientist\u2019 and acknowledged sea levels are rising, but whether it is caused by \u2018man-made\u2019 climate change or natural reasons is \u2018up for debate.\u2019\" In a questionnaire, the Post and Courier asked Cunningham and Mace: \"Do you believe in climate change?\" The answers were published Sept. 13, with Mace saying: \"I\u2019m not a scientist, but I do know we should consider all available data. South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District is in a unique part of the country subject to massive flooding and Atlantic storms, compounded by our low elevation.\" At their first debate, on Sept. 28, Cunningham and Mace were asked if they \"agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that climate change is happening due to manmade greenhouse emissions leading to an increase in extreme weather events.\" Mace replied: \"My opponent is going to tell you I\u2019m a climate denier, which is dishonest. My opponent has said that the science is settled on this. Well, the science is never settled. Scientists will tell you that. I look at the issue from every angle and try to find a solution, as I\u2019ve done as a state lawmaker. Scientists once said the Earth was flat and it\u2019s not, and so these things are evolving, as well.\" At their second and final scheduled debate, on Oct. 7, Cunningham and Mace were asked about what has caused a recent rise in the sea level in the area and what they would do about it. Mace said: \"Our Earth has had over 130 climate changes over its history. We are facing great climate change. We\u2019re seeing an increase in the number of hurricanes, sea levels are rising.\" In response to Cunningham\u2019s attack, Mace\u2019s campaign cited to PolitiFact an article published Oct. 14 in the Charleston City Paper. The newspaper said it asked Mace if humans are causing climate change, and she responded: \"Does man contribute to it? I mean, a lot of the science says that, too, but I want to stay informed and do as much as we can, but the other thing that\u2019s important to me is that we just cannot simply rely on the United States (to address it).\" Cunningham\u2019s claim that Mace \"denies climate change\" is accurate, but needs some clarification. Mace has hedged on the issue, saying the science isn\u2019t conclusive. We rate Cunningham\u2019s claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "You can vote in Wisconsin with a photo ID \"even if that ID is expired or you've moved.\"",
        "doc": "Can you vote in Wisconsin using an expired photo ID? That was the claim from U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, speaking at a virtual get-out-the-vote rally with Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and other Wisconsin politicians. Urging people to head to the polls, Moore said in the Oct. 20, 2020 call that voters can use an ID \"even if that ID is expired or you\u2019ve moved.\" Anyone voting in person Nov. 3 will have to show a photo ID in Wisconsin. Typically voters use a driver\u2019s license, state-issued identification card, military ID or passport. Some kinds of school IDs are also allowed, but employee IDs or membership IDs are not, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission. With Election Day fast approaching, let\u2019s see what the commission says about Moore\u2019s address and expiration claims. Photo IDs can indeed be expired, but with a key caveat. The commission says expired IDs are allowed as long as they were valid as of the last general election \u2014 that is, Nov. 6, 2018. An ID that expired before that date would not be acceptable to vote. On the address side, we again have a largely accurate claim with one caveat. Here\u2019s what the commission says: \"An acceptable Photo ID for voting does not have to include a current address. You only prove your address when registering.\" So previously registered voters only need to worry about whether the ID is active, and didn\u2019t expire before November 2018 \u2014 not the address. But voters who haven\u2019t yet registered need to provide documentation with a current address as proof of residence. That could be the same as the ID card \u2014 using a state driver\u2019s license or ID card \u2014 or a separate document such as a real estate tax bill, utility bill, bank statement or paycheck. Moore said you can vote in Wisconsin with an ID \"even if that ID is expired or you\u2019ve moved.\" There\u2019s a caveat for both halves of that claim. The ID can be expired, but for the Nov. 3 election it can\u2019t have expired before Nov. 6, 2018. And it\u2019s OK if the address is wrong, as long as the voter is already registered or provides some other document as proof of residence. So this statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That\u2019s our definition of Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Says \"Gov. Parson\u2019s administration purged 100,000 kids from Medicaid rolls.\"",
        "doc": "Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway has argued that Gov. Mike Parson can\u2019t be trusted to expand Medicaid, something voters approved in August. She has made it a cornerstone of her campaign for Parson\u2019s seat. In an Oct. 4 Facebook post, Galloway reinforced her argument by saying the Parson administration \"purged 100,000 kids from Medicaid.\" Galloway has repeated this claim in a number of TV ads. In an ad entitled \"First Thing,\" she said that Parson \"cut health care from 100,000 children.\" In an ad entitled \"Top Priority,\" she asserts that Parson \"kicked 100,000 kids off their health care.\" In an ad entitled \"Urgency,\" she said that Parson responded to rising health-care costs by \"cutting coverage for hundreds of thousands.\" The Parson campaign aggressively refutes this claim, going so far as to threaten legal action. PolitiFact Missouri obtained a letter sent by Parson campaign attorney Marc Ellinger to stations running one of Galloway\u2019s ads. The letter, dated Oct. 8, asks that the stations stop running the ad and asserts that it \"contains demonstrably false claims\" and that, among other things, \"the Governor has, at no time, taken any policy decision to change eligibility for children on Medicaid or any other health coverage in Missouri.\" During an Oct. 9 debate, we looked into a similar claim made by Green Party candidate Jerome Bauer who said that he lost his Medicaid \"alongside 100,000 Missouri children who got kicked off Medicaid.\" We found this to be accurate. But with a major party candidate making a similar claim, we wanted to take a deeper look at the records. Medicaid is a government program that provides health care to certain low-income people or those with disabilities. Missouri\u2019s Medicaid program is called MO HealthNet, and the Missouri Department of Social Services runs the program. The director of that department is appointed by and reports to the governor. Data from the Department of Social Services shows that from June 2018, the month Parson took office, to December 2019, the number of children enrolled in the program dropped by 96,989. Parson and other Republicans have previously said this is a result of fewer people needing the program due to an improving economy. Experts were skeptical of this explanation. \"It wasn\u2019t the economy,\" said Timothy McBride, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and former chair of the state MO HealthNet Oversight Committee. \"It was the process they used.\" The state government periodically does checks to make sure those receiving the benefits are still eligible for the program. The eligibility requirements are less stringent for children than for their parents. For a child to qualify, their parents must make less than three times the federal poverty level, but for the whole family, they must simply make less than the federal poverty level, so when a parent no longer qualifies, their child might still. After pressure from Democrats for an investigation, top staff at the Department of Social Services acknowledged in a legislative hearing that the state was dropping children from the program when their parents no longer qualified even when the children themselves still did. \"When I talked to people in other states, they were really surprised that that\u2019s how we did it,\" McBride said. \"They said, \u2018no, that\u2019s not how it should\u2019ve been done.\u2019 No other state did it that way.\" Republicans argued that parents could have simply reapplied for their children, but there is evidence that the program\u2019s eligibility system was flawed and that parents were given little guidance on the process. In several of its regular meetings, the MO HealthNet Oversight Committee discussed this. The minutes from the committee\u2019s August 2018 meeting show that the committee heard from a representative of Legal Aid of Western Missouri who explained that her clients were having trouble getting access to call centers after being denied Medicaid. She said that in July 2018, the average call center wait time was 30 minutes, compared to 4 minutes in February 2017. She also said that dropped calls increased from 4% the year prior to 60% that year. In that same meeting, one of the committee members, Jennifer Tidball, explained that the drop in enrollment can be attributed to the stability of the program\u2019s eligibility system, according to the meeting minutes. In the minutes from the April 2019 meeting, the committee heard from a different legal expert, this one representing Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, who described \"dysfunctional call centers, burdensome paperwork and the inability of receiving any help\" from local offices as issues his clients faced when trying to reapply. We reached out to the Galloway campaign who said they had the same evidence we did. On Facebook and in campaign ads, Galloway said that \"Governor Parson\u2019s administration purged 100,000 kids from Medicaid rolls.\" The Missouri Department of Social Services\u2019s data shows that 96,989 children were dropped from Medicaid under Parson\u2019s administration from June 2018 to December 2019. A letter from Parsons\u2019 campaign attorney states that \"the governor has, at no time, taken any policy decision to change eligibility for children on Medicaid or any other health coverage in Missouri.\" This does not refute Galloway\u2019s claim though. While Parson's administrationmay not have taken a formal step to change policy regarding Medicaid eligibility, we found that, under his leadership, the Department of Social Services changed the process for which eligibility is reviewed. That change resulted in 96,989 children being cut from Medicaid when they were still eligible. That\u2019s still about 3,000 children short of Galloway\u2019s claim, but her argument that Parson\u2019s administration removed a huge number of children from Medicaid is still accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Says she is ranked \"one of the most bipartisan senators in the Senate in the last 25 years.\"",
        "doc": "Republican Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst touted her bipartisan record at a debate against Democratic opponent Theresa Greenfield onOct. 15, saying she was ranked as one of the most bipartisan senators in the last 25 years. \"I am so honored to be named as one of the most bipartisan senators in the United States Senate in the last 25 years,\" she said. It was similar to a more specific statement about the rating\u2019s source that she made at aSept. 28 debatebetween the two candidates: \"I have been ranked as one of the most bipartisan Senators by Georgetown University over the last 25 years from any state of either party,\" Ernst said at the earlier debate. Ernst is seeking reelection against Democrat Theresa Greenfield, and has been criticized by Democrats for sticking with Republican President Donald Trump when voting in Congress. We checked the Georgetown University Bipartisan Index and saw that Ernst was ranked 34th among 98 senators actively serving in the U.S.Senate in 2019.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell and minority leader Chuck Schumer were excluded from the analysis. The Bipartisan Index, a joint project of the Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, also showed Ernst\u2019s voting record as ranking 39th out of 250 senators in the last 20 years. Ernst\u2019s campaign said the Bipartisan Index rating puts her in the top 15 percent of most bipartisan senators, campaign spokesperson Brendan Conley wrote in an email toThe Daily Iowan. A check of the index shows Ernst in the top 15.6 percent. Dan Diller, the policy director at The Lugar Center, wrote in an email that the Index is not a subjective judgment. Rather, he said, it is based on objective statistics applied to every senator to determine the frequency with which a member co-sponsors bills introduced by the senator\u2019s opposing party, and the frequency with which a member\u2019s own bills are co-sponsored by a member of the opposite party. He said senators are then compared with the average score of peers over the 25 years of data. \"Using this standard, Sen. Ernst scores very well, though not in the very top echelon,\" Diller wrote. \"Her lifetime score places her roughly in the 84th percentile of senators measured. I don\u2019t know Senator Ernst\u2019s precise words, but it would be for\u2026Iowa voters to decide whether they were accurate based on her rankings.\" While Diller wrote that Ernst has earned high scores \u2013 well above the historical average \u2013 indicating frequent cooperation with Democrats at the time legislation was introduced, he added that other measures of bipartisanship exist. So, we\u2019ll take a stab at her statement by looking at the data, and other measures, knowing that any U.S. senator votes more often with their own party than they do with the opposition party. Ernst may cooperate with Democrats at the time legislation is introduced, but she votes in line with Republican President Trump\u2019s position 91 percent of the time, according toFiveThirtyEight,which tracks the president\u2019s political positions and how senators vote on them. Raw vote counts aren\u2019t an absolute measure either, according to Ian Ostrander, an assistant professor of American politics at Michigan State University. \"Some votes matter much more than others,\" hewrote to PolitiFactin September. In another measure, though, Ernstis ranked as the second most conservativesenator by GovTrack, behind Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. The GovTrack ideology score measures senators \"according to their legislative behavior by whether they sponsor and co-sponsor overlapping sets of bills and resolutions with other Members of Congress.\" Overall, 26.4 percent of the bills Ernst co-sponsored in 2019 were introduced by a Democrat. GovTrackranked her 52nd among senatorsfor the percent of bills co-sponsored that were introduced by the other party. She introduced18 bipartisan bills in 2019, which put her in a five-way tie for 38th place among senators for the number of bills introduced, according to GovTrack. Of the48 bills Ernst introduced during the 119th Congress, 20 were cosponsored by Democrats, but only two of the bills Ernst introduced passed the Senate. Both were bipartisan votes on veterans issues, according to the U.S. Congress record of bills introduced. Ernst said she is ranked one of the most bipartisan senators in the Senate over the last 25 years. Ernst has high scores of frequent cooperation with Democrats when legislation is presented, higher than the historical average. That indicates she is willing to work across the aisle when introducing legislation, especially according to the Georgetown University Bipartisan Index. An overall claim that she is one of the most bipartisan U.S. senators may be slightly misleading because 38 current senators ranked in front of her in The Bipartisan Index\u2019s 2019 rankings. Moreover, a senator\u2019s bipartisanship also can be determined through voting records, rhetoric, and other factors. Ernst votes in line with the Republican president 90 percent of the time, and is considered by GovTrack, which gauges bills she sponsors and co-sponsors, to be one of the most conservative senators ideologically. Her score from other groups tempers the absolute claim of working in a strong, bipartisan fashion more often than her colleagues. Still, Ernst places relatively high in two rankings of bipartisanship. So we rate her statement Mostly True.",

        "claim": "\u201cWhile serving as Town Supervisor, Nate McMurray voted to raise taxes on homeowners.\u201d",
        "doc": "In a rematch between Rep. Chris Jacobs, a Republican, and Democrat Nate McMurray for the 27th Congressional District seat, Jacobs says his opponent has a track record of raising taxes and a desire to do so again. In a large postcard sent to voters, the Jacobs campaign links McMurray with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of Queens and says: \"Nate McMurray Big Tax, Big Spend: An AOC Progressive Who Will Raise Taxes.\" The mailer claims that \"While serving as Town Supervisor, Nate McMurray voted to raise taxes on homeowners.\" We were curious about McMurray\u2019s record on Grand Island, where he served as supervisor for four years, beginning in 2016. We spoke with McMurray, who confirmed that as a member of the town board on Grand Island, he voted to slightly increase taxes. He also proposed budgets, as supervisor, with slight tax increases, he said. During all four years of his tenure, the increases remained under the property tax cap, he said. He also said that he was one of five people on the board, where Republicans held the other four seats. \"I had no control to raise taxes myself,\" he said. Taxes increased about $27 in 2018for a house assessed at $210,600. The tax rate for the general fund, which makes up a large amount of town spending, decreased by 3.1%, but an increase in the sewer district tax led to the increase. The 20% of residents without sewer access generally did not have an increase. The town\u2019s official meeting minutes of the board session with the budget vote show that McMurray voted in favor of the increase. McMurray said he sometimes had to fight to keep the increases from getting too high during negotiations with other board members. \"I\u2019m one of five, and everybody has their pet thing.\" In the 2019 budget, adopted in late 2018, the tax levy, or the amount raised in taxes, increasedby 28% on Grand Island for the sewer system fund, though overall levy increase was 2.63 percent.Rates increased only for people using the sewer systemand went down for those who do not. The combined levy for the general and highway funds fell by 4%. McMurray voted in favor of this budget. The town's sewer system needed costly repairs, and a prior administration reached a deal with the state Department of Environmental Conservation, McMurray said. It was his administration's obligation to fund them, he said, a statement supported by a 2017outside auditor's report. The general fund tax rate was lower when he left office than it was during his first year, but that is not true of all of the funds that tax residents. McMurray said that the mailer makes it seem like he was recklessly raising taxes as supervisor. \"It\u2019s acting like we\u2019re willy-nilly raising taxes,\" he said. \"Sure, there was a moderate increase under the tax cap.\" McMurray has campaigned on his fiscal management of Grand Island, including a claim from 2018, in which he said he was a \"small-town supervisor who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had.\" PolitiFact rated that claim True. Jacobs said McMurray voted to raise taxes on homeowners while he was town supervisor on Grand Island. McMurray said that he raised taxes slightly while he was supervisor, which is corroborated by other documents. He also said that he couldn\u2019t do anything unilaterally, and that he was a member of a five-member board. We rate Jacobs\u2019 claim True.",

        "claim": "An \u201canti-Black Lives Matter\u201d flag replaced the American flag behind President Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally.",
        "doc": "As the 2020 election heads into its final days, a Facebook post is claiming that President Donald Trump had replaced the American flag with an \"anti-Black Lives Matter\" flag at a recent Wisconsin rally. At issue: A Thin Blue Line flag that was prominently featured behind Trump at an Oct. 24, 2020 rally in Waukesha. The flag essentially is a black-and-white version of the American flag, with a single red stripe replaced by a blue one. That blue stripe is meant to symbolize police officers as the \"thin blue line\" between order and chaos. The Facebook post featured a screenshot of a Twitter post by author and Dartmouth College English professor Jeff Sharlet, that included a photo and read: \"Tonight in Wisconsin. First the anti-Black Lives Matter flag flew outside his rallies, then beside the American flag. Now it has replaced the American flag. That\u2019s significant.\" Alongside the screenshot, the Facebook post read: \"Trump flew the anti-Black Lives Matter flag at his rally in Wisconsin. So much for not disrespecting the troops \u2026\" The post in question was shared by a group called \"The Other 98%\" -- a left-leaning nonprofit, according to its bio on Facebook -- the day after the rally. The post has been shared more than 2,500 additional times and reacted to by more than 7,200 people. This post was flagged as a part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So was the flag really flying behind Trump during his Waukesha rally? And is it an \"anti-Black Lives Matter\" flag? In a review of photos of the Oct. 24, 2020 Waukesha rally taken by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Thin Blue Line flag is hung prominently behind the risers behind behind the podium where Trump spoke. The flag was featured very prominently at the rally -- a change from the last several Wisconsin rallies that Trump has held in other cities. In Janesville on Oct. 17, 2020, the flag was featured on one side of the stage, while a larger American flag was featured on the other side of the stage, photos from the Journal Sentinel showed. In Mosinee on Sept. 17, 2020, Trump spoke in front of Air Force One and no flags were prominently displayed, according to photos by the Journal Sentinel. So the portion of the post that says that the flag was featured prominently -- and more prominently than at earlier rallies -- is on the money. But what about the meaning of the flag? The flag has been popularized by the company \"Thin Blue Line USA,\" which also sells clothing emblazoned with the symbol. According to the company\u2019s website, the flag is meant to be a sign for \"promoting compassion and support for our nation\u2019s police officers.\" The company began marketing the flag in 2014 amid the Blue Lives Matter movement, which itself was launched in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. The Black Lives Matter movement arose in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who killed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida, according to the movement\u2019s website. Black Lives Matter has been invoked around the country this year during massive protests that were launched by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. In a June 8, 2020, article by The Marshall Project headlined \"The Short, Fraught History of the \u2018Thin Blue Line\u2019 American Flag,\" Andrew Johnson, president of Thin Blue Line USA said: \"The flag has no association with racism, hatred, bigotry. It\u2019s a flag to show support for law enforcement\u2014no politics involved.\" According to the article: Jacob said the flag was not a direct reaction to the first Black Lives Matter protests\u2014an idea suggested by a previous origin story in Harper\u2019s\u2014but he allows he may have first seen the thin blue line image after those protests spurred the circulation of pro-police imagery online. \"That\u2019s maybe why it came to my eyes,\" he said. Whatever the intended meaning of the flag, it has come to carry different connotations to different people At protests in Charlottesville in 2017, where white supremacist groups and supporters gathered to protest the removal of Confederate statues throughout the country, the blue-line flag was featured alongside Confederate flags, according to an Aug. 18, 2017 report from USA TODAY. (The company disavowed its use in Charlottesville) A July 31, 2020 NPR report highlighted a fight between a Massachusetts fire department flying the flags in honor of fallen police officers, and community members who felt the flag was an overt display of racism. A June 9. 2020 Politico report said even police officers have mixed reactions to the symbol, with some departments banning it outright, while others display it on government-owned vehicles. The Politico report also noted that the flag is controversial because of its likeness to the American flag, and because of the U.S. Flag Code, which states: \"The (American) flag should never have placed upon it, nor any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture or drawing of any nature.\" When asked why the flag was placed behind the president, Wisconsin Trump Victory -- the state\u2019s Trump campaign group -- did not respond. To be sure, it is possible to support police officers and the Black Lives Matter movement. But Trump himself has been harshly critical of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, labeling them as violent and claiming they were stoked by anti-government elements. A Facebook post claims an \"anti-Black Lives Matter\" flag replaced the American flag behind Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally. To be sure, the flag itself violates the U.S. Flag Code, and should not be considered a legitimate U.S. flag by those standards. In terms of the Facebook claim, The image and description -- that the flag has taken on greater prominence at the Trump rallies in Wisconsin -- is on target. And the Thin Blue Line flag has become a prominent part of the pro-police Blue Lives Matter movement -- which arose to counter the Blak Lives Matter movement. That said, while it is possible to support both, Trump has made clear he opposes the Black Lives Matter protests -- and made that opposition, and a strong law-and-order message, a prominent part of his re-election campaign. So, those attending the rally or seeing the images could easily see the flag as an \"anti Black Lives Matter flag.\" We rate the claim Mostly True. ",

        "claim": "\u201cNow with the COVID-19 \u2026 more people are dependent on drugs or alcohol.\u201d",
        "doc": "For a decade, West Virginia has struggled with a rising tide of drug addiction. Has it gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic, when many Americans have had to keep their distance from friends and family? That\u2019s what Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said during an interview with the Washington Examiner on Aug. 19. In the interview, Manchin discussed a bill he\u2019s sponsoring, the Crisis Care Improvement and Suicide Prevention Act. The legislation would direct states to use 5% of their federal Mental Health Block Grant funding to support crisis care services. Neither Manchin\u2019s bill nor a House counterpart has advanced in the current Congress. \"The number of overdose cases, exponentially, is just out of proportion,\" Manchin told the newspaper. \"And they're rising tremendously from the opiate (problem), and now with the COVID-19, and suicide, more people are dependent on drugs or alcohol.\" Manchin, whose office did not respond to inquiries for this article, got some of his terminology wrong in his comment to the Examiner. But more broadly, he has a point that West Virginia and the nation have experienced upticks in drug and alcohol use during the pandemic. Manchin referred to people becoming \"dependent\" on drugs or alcohol. That means that an individual has a long-term reliance on drugs to function, as opposed to specific instances of using drugs. Complicating matters further, \"dependence\" is not considered the same as \"addiction,\" though the two conditions can overlap. In 2013, the definitive reference work in the field, the American Psychiatric Association's \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\" replaced the terms \"substance abuse\" and \"substance dependence\" with the single category \"substance use disorder,\" with three subcategories, mild, moderate and severe. This is a long way of saying that Manchin misused the term \"dependence\" to refer to a rise in overdoses or other drug-related crisesof the sort his bill would target. That said, the statistics do back up Manchin\u2019s concerns on heightened use of drugs and alcohol during the pandemic. Statistics from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources show that emergency room visits related to overdoses rose were higher in June, July and August 2020 than they were during the same months in 2019. There is also evidence that rates of overdoses have increased across the country more broadly during the pandemic. We looked at data from the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program, which collects real-time data from law enforcement agencies, fire departments, emergency medical services, hospitals and medical examiners. The data shows that after the onset of the pandemic in March, almost 62% of participating counties experienced an increase in reported overdoses. The number of suspected overdose reports rose by almost 17.6% between the weeks before and after state stay-at-home orders were imposed, the data shows. There\u2019s also evidence of increased alcohol use after the pandemic hit. A study by researchers from the RAND Corp. and Indiana University\u2019s School of Public Health found that self-reported use of alcohol increased by one day more per month for three out of every four adults during the pandemic. Increases were seen in such subgroups as women, adults between 30 and 59, and non-Hispanic whites. Manchin said, \"Now with the COVID-19 \u2026 more people are dependent on drugs or alcohol.\" Manchin misused the term \"dependent\" to refer to overdoses and other individual drug crises like those targeted by his bill. (It\u2019s also no longer the preferred term in the field.) That said, official West Virginia data shows increases in emergency room visits due to overdoses in June, Julyand August2020 compared with the same months in 2019. National data shows increases in reported overdoses in a majority of participating counties, as well as increases after the enactment of stay-at-home orders. And one academic study found increased alcohol use nationally during the pandemic. We rate the statement Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Upton \u201cvoted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions\u201d",
        "doc": "Jon Hoadley, a Democrat seeking to represent western Michigan\u2019s 6th congressional district, is attacking his Republican opponent, Rep. Fred Upton, for his voting record on health care. \"He voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,\" an ad from Hoadley states. The basis of Hoadley\u2019s attack is Upton\u2019s consistent opposition to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which barred insurance companies from discriminating \u2014 in pricing and coverage \u2014 against people with preexisting medical conditions, such as cancer survivors and kids with diabetes as Hoadley\u2019s ad notes. The ACA also introduced federal subsidies for Americans to buy coverage in the individual insurance market and for states to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income Americans. In 2019, more than 500,000 Michiganders were covered under plans purchased in the individual market, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. And today, a little more than 800,000 are covered under the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion. A repeal or overturning of the ACA, and the loss of its protections, would put that coverage at risk, experts say. In the five years that followed the ACA\u2019s passage, Upton voted 12 times for bills, budget resolutions and amendments that called for repealing the law. More recently, Upton has spoken out against Republican efforts to repeal the ACA without a replacement. \"You simply cannot take what would be millions of people off coverage without a backup plan ready to go,\" he told The Detroit News in April 2019. That month, he was one of only eight Republicans who supported a resolution urging the Trump administration to end its effort to overturn the ACA. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments next month on a case supported by the administration asking the court to invalidate the law. Hoadley\u2019s claim includes recovered COVID-19 patients among those whose coverage would be at risk, but Upton\u2019s votes to repeal the ACA came years before the pandemic. Upton spokesperson Josh Paciorek said, \"Fred believes we must forge a bipartisan path to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable care while always protecting preexisting conditions.\" Nonetheless, Hoadley\u2019s ad gives an accurate count of Upton\u2019s votes from 2011 to 2015 and their potential impact. The Hoadley ad cites 12 times that Upton voted to repeal or defund the ACA. Here's how they break down: Under the ACA, millions of Americans buy their health insurance through the individual market or receive coverage through the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. If the law is repealed or struck down by the Supreme Court, many could face higher costs for health insurance, lose automatic coverage or become unable to afford coverage. A New York Times analysis says as many as 21 million people would be at risk of becoming uninsured. They would also lose protection under ACA provisions that bar discrimination against people with preexisting medical conditions. President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders pledging to preserve these protections have no legal effect, experts say. About 54 million Americans had a preexisting condition in 2018 that would likely leave them uninsurable in the individual insurance market if the ACA were repealed, according to a 2019 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That includes 29% \u2014 just over 1.7 million \u2014 of Michiganders under 65. The implementation of the ACA\u2019s major protections helped insure thousands of Michiganders in the individual market soon after Upton cast his first vote to repeal the law in 2011. By the time the preexisting condition protections kicked in in 2014, Upton had voted to repeal the ACA four times and supported three budget resolutions that assumed savings from the law\u2019s repeal. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation said that votes cast before 2014 may not have led to immediate coverage losses. But she said Congress relies on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that measure the impact of legislation over the next 10 years. In 2014, nearly 550,000 Michiganders were insured by plans purchased in the individual market, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, up 74,600 from the previous year. The number was 511,700 last year. In mid-2014, Michigan\u2019s expanded Medicaid program covered roughly 58,000. Today, it covers more than800,000. An analysis this year from the nonpartisan Center for American Progress estimates that repealing the ACA would result in 827,000 Michiganders losing their insurance. A Hoadley ad statesthat Upton \"voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,\" citing his votes to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act. Four of those votes were for legislation that would have repealed the law. The eight other votes cited by the campaign laid the groundwork for repealing the ACA, but would have required additional action from lawmakers. Repealing the ACA would have jeopardized health coverage for Michiganders covered under plans purchased in the individual market and the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program.

        "claim": "Joe Biden \u201cwants to get rid of something called \u2018stepped up basis\u2019\u201d that reduces inheritance taxes.",
        "doc": "On the campaign trail back in October 2019, before he was the Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden pitched his plan to provide two years of free community college to students. His campaign said the plan would be funded in part by eliminating a tax policy called \"stepped-up basis\" that reduces inheritance taxes. Stepped-up basis provides a big benefit to those who inherit certain assets, including real estate. It means that the person who inherited the asset only has to pay tax on its gains in value beginning from the time it was inherited, rather than from the time it was originally purchased, according to the nonprofit Tax Policy Center. The difference in tax liability can be significant, the Tax Policy Center points out, and Facebook users noted the same thing. One Oct. 25 Facebook post says, \"Did you know Biden wants to get rid of something called \u2018stepped up basis\u2019??? How does this affect you! When your parents pass and leave you the family house normally you would inherit that property at what it is worth today. If you were to sell that house you would only pay taxes on the gain from what it is worth today and what it sells for. If Biden does away with \u2018stepped up basis\u2019 you will inherit the property for what your parents paid for the property. If you decide to sell you will pay taxes on the difference between the original purchase price and what it sells for today.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although, in this case, the claim gets it right. Biden\u2019s campaign team specifically mentioned eliminating stepped-up basis in October 2019 when Biden unveiled his community-college plan, ABC News reported. The issue came up again in June, when Biden told donors at a fundraising event that he intends to roll back Trump\u2019s tax cuts and \"close loopholes like capital gains and stepped-up basis,\" according to CNBC. Stepped-up basis takes its name from the \"step up\" to fair market value that happens when a person inherits certain assets. The basis \u2014 which is another way of saying the original purchase price, plus improvements, minus depreciation \u2014 adjusts to current fair market value at the time it is bequeathed. If the asset is sold after it\u2019s inherited, then the stepped-up value is the base that gains are measured against for taxes. Any gains in value from the time of original purchase to the time the asset is \"stepped up\" to market value when inherited are not taxed. The policy has been part of the U.S. tax code since 1921, according to The Hill, which reports that its origins are unclear but likely related to the difficulty in determining the original price of assets at that time. Biden has said he wants to eliminate the policy, and if he is elected, he can propose changes to tax law, but only Congress can enact tax laws. A Facebook post claims that Biden wants to get rid of stepped-up basis, a tax policy that allows people inheriting and selling certain assets to only pay tax on the increase in value from the time it was inherited, rather than on the gains in value from the time it was originally purchased. Biden and his campaign have said that he wants to eliminate stepped-up basis. His campaign says the increased tax revenue would be used to help fund Biden\u2019s plan for free community college.

        "claim": "Says U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner \u201cvoted five times against protecting pre-existing conditions.\"",
        "doc": "With the elections around the corner, Missouri\u2019s 2nd Congressional District is in the eye of the storm. Democratic challenger Jill Schupp and incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner are battling for the district that includes parts of St. Louis, St. Charles and Jefferson counties. The Cook Political Report says the race is a toss-up. In one of Schupp\u2019s attacks in a video on Facebook, Schupp stated: \"Rep. Wagner doesn't want you to know that she's voted five times against protecting pre-existing conditions.\" In a time when people with pre-existing conditions are vulnerable, is it really true that she voted against these protections? Let\u2019s take a look. Introduced in 2010, the Affordable Care Act was designed to broaden the reach of health care coverage. In the past decade, gaps in health coverage have decreased. Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration oppose the law and have taken steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act. One protection at the core of the Affordable Care Act outlaws denying coverage to those who live with pre-existing conditions. A pre-existing condition is a health problem that was around before someone\u2019s health coverage began. According to the liberal Center for American Progress, Missouri\u2019s 2nd Congressional District has more than 320,000 people living with pre-existing conditions. We asked Jill Schupp\u2019s campaign to provide evidence of Wagner\u2019s votes. Schupp\u2019s communications director Natalie Edelstein provided five unsuccessful attempts by the Republican-led House to repeal the Affordable Care Act while President Barack Obama was in office. In 2013, Wagner voted to repeal the account restrictions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR 25). In 2014, Wagner voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HRs 96). In 2015, Wagner voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (HR 596). In 2015, Wagner voted for a proposed amendment that repealed the Affordable Care Act (HR 27). In 2015, Wagner voted again on the budget above which would establish a reserve fund and allow health care spending to be adjusted. These votes are in line with Schupp\u2019s claim. It\u2019s worth noting that one of the votes is a second vote on the same budget. Also, only one of these is an actual vote to directly repeal the ACA, H.R. 596; the rest are mainly budget votes that cut or redirect funding to the ACA. HealthReformVotes.org, a website that tracks votes concerning health care reform, cites Wagner\u2019s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act as unfavorable to consumers. We asked Wagner\u2019s campaign to comment on this claim. Press secretary Arthur Bryant sent a history of Ann Wagner\u2019s votes, as well as legislation Wagner has co-sponsored to keep people insured. Here are the votes sent by Wagner\u2019s campaign from 2019: Wagner voted on HR 5 which would guarantee that no Americans could be denied coverage or charged higher premiums as a result of their health status. Wagner voted to recommit the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019, which would make it clear that pre-existing conditions protections cannot be waived under current law. Alongside colleagues in Congress, Wagner introduced the Protecting Patients with Preexisting Conditions Act in 2019. The act would amend the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to guarantee coverage even if the Affordable Care Act is completely repealed. The act also seeks to outlaw discriminatory premium rates. As it stands, the Protecting Patients with Pre-existing Conditions Act was introduced a year ago and hasn\u2019t been acted on since. Another piece of legislation Wagner co-sponsored, HR 1066, aims to keep pre-existing conditions protections in place. Wagner also co-sponsored the Maintaining Protections with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2018. PolitiFact found that this (as well as another bill) has loopholes in denying coverage if companies do not have the capacity to do so. Schupp stated in a Facebook post that \"Ann Wagner doesn\u2019t want you to know that she\u2019s voted five times against protecting people with pre-existing conditions.\" Wagner has repeatedly voted for legislation that repealed the Affordable Care Act, which establishes protections for those with pre-existing conditions. If the repeals had been successful, the protections for pre-existing conditions would be gone. Wagner\u2019s introduction of various bills as alternatives to the Affordable Care Act that would guarantee protections suggests that\u2019s not the whole story. She has co-sponsored legislation to keep protections in place, but there are loopholes that could jeopardize coverage if the Affordable Care Act was dismantled. We rate this statement Mostly True.",

        "claim": "My 2018 election was the first time Speaker Robin Vos has lost a Republican-held seat",
        "doc": "Wisconsin is among the most gerrymandered states in the country, but have Democrats only flipped a single Republican seat in the last seven years? That\u2019s the claim from state Rep. Robyn Vining, a Democrat who accomplished that feat when she beat Republican Matt Adamczyk by 138 votes in 2018. That handed Vining, D-Wauwatosa, the District 14 seat previously held by Republican Dale Kooyenga, who ran for the state Senate that year. In an Oct. 25, 2020, episode of WISN-TV\u2019s \"UpFront\" program, Vining said her win was unique during the tenure of Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. The Rochester Republican has headed the chamber since 2013. \"I\u2019m the only Democrat to beat the speaker,\" Vining said, discussing her 2020 campaign. \"This is the first time Speaker Vos has lost a seat, and so he wants it back.\" A federal court said in 2016 the maps drawn by Wisconsin Republicans in 2011 were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years, designed to \"secure Republican control of the Assembly under any likely future electoral scenario for the remainder of the decade.\" Calculating gerrymandering is an imprecise business, but two studies have agreed with that court finding, ranking Wisconsin among the most five skewed states in the nation. Has the maneuver really been as beneficial to Republicans as Vining claims? Republicans control nearly two-thirds of the 99-member Assembly, a level they have held have since the new maps were drawn in 2011. Wisconsin Democrats enter the 2020 election hoping to cut into Republicans 63-34 majority, while the GOP is looking to lock in a veto-proof majority. RELATED: Attacking Republicans, Democratic state senator says Wisconsin among most gerrymandered states Gerrymandering is done by drawing legislative boundaries in such a way that voters in one party are concentrated in a limited number of districts, while voters from the other are spread out just enough to ensure victories. Lawmakers accomplish this by drawing irregularly shaped districts that strategically include and exclude certain groups of voters rather than cordoning off districts based on geography or municipality. The result in Wisconsin is Democrats tend to win their districts by a landslide, while Republicans win by narrower margins. The 2018 election highlighted this, as Republicans didn\u2019t even bother sending out a candidate in 27 of the 36 Assembly districts Democrats won, Ballotpedia reported. In the general election contests with two candidates, Democratic winners outpolled their Republican counterparts by an average of 37%, while Republican winners won by an average of 20%. In another sign of the lack of competitive districts, a whopping 49 Assembly races were uncontested in 2016. With that context, let\u2019s focus in on Vining\u2019s claim about seat flipping since 2013. There were three elections in that span \u2014 every Assembly member is up for election in even-numbered years \u2014 and the Republican majority hardly budged. Republicans held 63 seats after the 2014 election, picked up one in the 2016 election, then dropped back to 63 with Vining\u2019s victory in 2018. Most Democratic victories in that span came from incumbents. But a review of the Wisconsin Blue Book\u2019s election results for 2014, 2016 and 2018 shows more than a dozen non-incumbent Democrats were elected to the Assembly in that span. For all but Vining, however, those lawmakers were filling a seat previously held by another Democrat. The closest call came in 2014 in District 51, centered around Dodgeville an hour west of Madison. Republican Todd Novak won the seat by 65 votes that year, and it stayed close in the two elections since, which he won by 723 votes in 2016 and 332 votes in 2018. Vining said her victory in 2018 was the first seat to flip from Republican to Democrat since Vos took over the Assembly in 2013. Almost every Wisconsin district has been locked one way or another as a result of the maps drawn by Republicans in 2011. Only one district flipped from Democrat to Republican in that span. And only one flipped from Republican to Democrat \u2014 in line with Vining\u2019s statement. We rate this claim True.",

Jacobs, a Republican, countered McMurray\u2019s claim. \"I am for protecting pre-existing conditions,\"he said during a debate at St. Joseph\u2019s Collegiate Institute. \"Actually, in the first couple of months I actually co-sponsored legislation to do just that.\" Protecting people with pre-existing conditions is a priority of the nearly three-quarters of Americans, according to a July 2019 poll. So we wondered about Jacobs\u2019 claim. Jacobs co-sponsored the \"Pre-existing Conditions Protection Act of 2019,\" on Sept. 30, about two months following his swearing-in on July 21. The bill, H.R. 692, was introduced on Jan. 18, 2019, by Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., but no other action has been taken on it. It has 83 co-sponsors, all Republicans. Jacobs\u2019 spokesperson, Cam Savage, told us the bill contains key provisions that protect patients, including prohibiting insurers from excluding certain benefits based on pre-existing conditions, prohibiting charging people with pre-existing conditions higher premiums, and guaranteeing that people will be issued policies. \"This bill is one step in the process to improve health care for all Americans should the ACA be struck down by the Supreme Court,\" Savage said. In New York, there are protections for people with pre-existing conditions, regardless of whether the ACA is struck down by the high court. But without the federal law, states also face losing the federal subsidies that help pay for the coverage.New York state could face dire financial consequences, including the loss of $3.7 billion for the stateand nearly $600 million for counties, according to a state report from 2017. In addition, the state estimated that 2.7 million New Yorkers would lose coverage. We reached out to KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of information about health policy. The bill contains some of the protections contained in the ACA, but not all of them, said senior fellow Karen Pollitz. Pollitz confirmed the bill forbids insurers from selling policies that lack certain coverage based on a customer\u2019s pre-existing conditions. It also prevents insurers from turning patients down if they apply for coverage, known as guaranteed issue. The bill\u2019s provision on whether groups of insured people could be charged more if someone in the group is sick contains the wrong language, Pollitz said, though she thinks that it was a mistake and not intentional. Though the bill contains those provisions, Pollitz said people with pre-existing conditions could still face barriers to coverage based on how the insurance market behaved before the ACA. \"There is a history with all of this,\" Pollitz said. \"This isn\u2019t theoretical.\" The bill does not require policies to contain certain benefit standards, she said. Some policies could omit coverage for major medical services, such as chemotherapy or maternity care. Healthy people would purchase these cheaper plans, leaving sicker people to pay for costly plans that contain pools of mostly sick people. The bill also doesn\u2019t prohibit lifetime limits, so patients with costly medical conditions could reach the end of their insurance coverage while they still need it. Other protections, such as prohibitions on discriminating based on gender, age, and out-of-pocket caps aren\u2019t in this GOP House bill, she said. The subsidies, or funds that allow people to purchase plans for lower costs, are not in the bill either. Based on all of this, those people with expensive health conditions probably couldn\u2019t purchase insurance for an affordable premium on the individual market, she said. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which focuses on policy effects on people with low incomes, came to the same conclusion in its analysis. \"Eliminating the ACA\u2019s financial assistance would put coverage out of reach for millions of low- and moderate-income consumers, including many with pre-existing conditions,\" wrote Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst. \"It also would create severe adverse selection in state insurance markets, since it would remove a major financial incentive for healthy people to enroll in plans that pool risk across people with and without serious health needs.\" Jacobs said he co-sponsored legislation to protect people with pre-existing conditions. He did co-sponsor a bill that protects people with pre-existing conditions in certain respects. But experts said that to truly ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can access coverage, more comprehensive action is needed. If the ACA is repealed or struck down and this legislation is put in its place, people with pre-existing conditions could find the coverage they need to be unaffordable, they said. So while his statement is accurate, it needs clarification. We rate Jacobs\u2019 claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Says Ann Wagner\u2019s campaign \"has taken millions of dollars from special interests, more than almost anyone else in Congress.\u201d",
        "doc": "It\u2019s all about following the money. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran an ad on the 2020 Priorities website calling out Missouri\u2019s 2nd District Rep. Ann Wagner. Among other claims, it asserted: \"Wagner\u2019s campaign has taken millions of dollars from special interests, more than almost anyone else in Congress.\" Money plays an ever-growing role in politics, so it\u2019s worth looking into. According to DCCC spokesperson Courtney Rice, Wagner received more than $3 million from corporate political action committees throughout her political career, which started in the 2012 election cycle when she was elected. In that same vein, Wagner also received more than $2 million \"from the broader financial industry,\" according to Rice. We were directed to searches from MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics, two non-partisan research groups that track campaign contributions, political donors and the influence of money on politics. According to MapLight, since 2011 Wagner received $3.1 million from \"corporate PACs,\" which MapLight defines as when a political action committee identifies its affiliation to a corporation in a \"statement of organization\" filed with the Federal Election Commission. The Center for Responsive Politics, also known by its website name OpenSecrets.org, tracks all kinds of PACs, and showed higher numbers. According to the center, Wagner received more than $6.4 million from a variety of PACs, including corporate political action committees. Of that $6.4 million, more than $2.6 million came from PACs affiliated with the finance, insurance and real estate industries. In addition, she received: $226,022 from registered lobbyists; $1.7 million from non-PAC sources in the finance, insurance or real estate industries; $547,291 from non-PAC law firms and lawyers. Wagner received $4.3 million from the financial/insurance/real estate sector, as coded by the Center for Responsive Politics from both individuals and political action committees. Out of the more than 1,500 U.S. representatives listed who have served between 1990 and 2020, Wagner ranked 82nd for most contributions received from this sector. This is behind other politicians from Missouri, including U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt and U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, who received more than $8 million and $5 million respectively during their terms in Congress. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer received the most money from the financial/insurance/real estate sector, over $28 million. In the 2020 election cycle, Wagner received $668,560 from corporate PACs, according to MapLight. She was No. 54 out of 435 members of the House when she received $56,471 from lobbyists this election cycle. Fellow Republican congressmen from Missouri \u2014Billy Long, Jason Smith and Luetkemeyer \u2014received more from lobbyists than Wagner in this cycle. From the financial/insurance/real service sector, Wagner was No. 20 out of all House members in this cycle as she received $1,137,674. In an ad, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said, \"Wagner\u2019s campaign has taken millions of dollars from special interests, more than almost anyone else in Congress.\" We can break this claim down into two parts: Wagner\u2019s campaign has received millions of dollars from special interests. That amount received is more than almost anyone else in Congress. It\u2019s true that Wagner\u2019s campaign has received millions of dollars from corporate political action committees, more than the majority of elected representatives and senators. MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics both confirm this. However, a significant number of senators and representatives have received more than Wagner from special interest groups, both in this election cycle and over the course of their respective political careers. For these reasons, we rate this claim as Half True.",

        "claim": "\u201cNobody's ever seen a number like this\u2026 (33.1%) economic growth is four times greater than what the experts expected.\u201d",
        "doc": "For months, President Donald Trump has been predicting huge economic growth in the third quarter of 2020, and on Oct. 29 it became official. Government numbers showed a 7.4% jump in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the quarter before. If that lasted for a year, it would add up to a growth rate of 33.1%. \"Nobody's ever seen a number like this,\" Trump told his supporters at a rally in Tampa, Fla. \"This explosive economic growth is four times greater than what the experts expected.\" Trump is half right. Going back to 1947, the earliest point in the government data, this rise from one quarter to the next tops them all. (You have to also consider how far it had dropped.) But as for surprising the experts, Trump is off target. Each month, the Wall Street Journal asks over 60 economic forecasters what they think the future holds. The average estimate has risen steadily. In September, it stood at 23.9% growth. By the October survey, it stood at 28.5%. The average of all the guesses was about five percentage points under the official figure. That\u2019s a far cry from the 400 points that Trump said. There are other ways to crunch those estimates. The median forecast was 30%, which is a bit closer but still under the actual figure. The Trump campaign noted that estimates back as recently as July had growth in the neighborhood of 12% or lower. One particularly low forecast of 13.6% came from an economic model at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in October. Trump didn\u2019t specify which experts he had in mind, but it would always be possible to point to the more pessimistic predictions. The increase of 33.1% is historic. (It\u2019s so large, the expected revisions won\u2019t change its ranking.) But the economic damage of the coronavirus has been severe. The record growth in the third quarter came after a record drop in the quarter before, and the economy is not back to where it once was. In terms of jobs, 9.6 million fewer people are employed than a year ago. The economy remains $70 billion smaller than it was two years ago. While it\u2019s customary to convert GDP growth in one quarter to a yearly number, University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers said that hinges on that growth continuing. \"There's no chance that will happen, so the annualized rate answers a question no one is asking,\" Wolfers tweeted Oct. 29. The Wall Street Journal survey of economists backs up Wolfer\u2019s point. The average estimated growth is about 3.8% for the last quarter of 2020. Trump said no one has ever seen growth like the country saw in the third quarter, and it was four times higher than experts expected. Trump is literally correct that the jump in GDP is the highest as far back as the government numbers go. However, it came after a drop that was equally historic, and both were driven by a pandemic, the likes of which hasn\u2019t been seen in a century. Trump erred on the expectations of forecasters. Experts were predicting high growth. The average in one large survey of economists came in about five percentage points low, but that\u2019s a fraction of the error Trump stated.

        "claim": "Says President Donald Trump \"thinks that $15 an hour minimum wage is too much for essential workers.\"",
        "doc": "As part of the Scranton vs. Park Avenue contrast he\u2019s trying to draw against President Donald Trump, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has sought to highlight the differences between his stance on raising the minimum wage and Trump\u2019s. At an event in Dallas, Pa., on Oct. 24, Biden said that Trump \"thinks that $15 an hour minimum wage is too much for essential workers.\" In reality, Trump\u2019s position is a bit more complicated than that. The federal minimum wage has been fixed at $7.25 an hour since 2009. In all, 29 states (and a range of cities) have set a higher minimum wage, but in remainder of the country, the $7.25 federal floor prevails. Biden, for his part, has expressed clear support for raising the minimum wage to $15, saying on his campaign website that he would \"increase the federal minimum wage to $15.\" Biden reiterated this position during the final presidential debate on Oct. 22 when moderator Kristen Welker of NBC News asked about it. \"Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage,\" Welker said at the debate. \"I do,\" Biden responded. During this exchange, Trump interjected, offering a position that wasn\u2019t as clear-cut in favor of a wage hike as Biden\u2019s was, but that also didn\u2019t close the door on it. Trump expressed concern that the wage hike could result in employers laying off lower-wage employees. \"How are you helping your small businesses when you\u2019re forcing wages? What\u2019s going to happen, and what\u2019s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees,\" Trump said. Trump added his preference for state-by-state minimum wages. \"Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option.\" (It\u2019s worth noting that no change would be required for this to happen, since states can already set a minimum wage higher than the federal level.) That said, Trump added that he\u2019d \"consider it to an extent \u2026 in a second administration. But not to a level that\u2019s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option.\" One thing that\u2019s clear is that the White House officially opposed a bill to enact $15 minimum wage in 2019. That came when the House was considering H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. All but six Democrats voted for the measure while only three Republicans voted for it. The bill would phase in a $15 minimum wage over a seven-year period. As the measure was being considered in the House, the White House weighed in, as White Houses often do on major pieces of legislation, in a document known as a Statement of Administration Policy. The administration wrote that a $15 an hour minimum wage would \"reverse\" recent economic progress \"and hurt workers. \u2026 The successful efforts to reduce taxes, eliminate regulations, and implement fairer trade deals are driving economic growth and increasing workers\u2019 take-home pay far more effectively and efficiently than legislation like H.R. 582, which would eliminate jobs and reduce total wages for American workers.\" The document concluded that \"if H.R. 582 were presented to the president in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.\" The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry to clarify the president\u2019s current position. A final note: Some economic commentators, including some who ordinarily lean liberal, have previously told PolitiFact that Trump has a point on geographic variations. They suggest that while a $15 minimum wage may be justified in metropolitan areas with high costs of living, it would be disruptive to the economy in lower-cost areas, with up to half of workers getting a raise, potentially resulting in job losses and inflation. Biden\u2019s statements have not directly addressed the question of whether it would support regional variations in a minimum wage bill, and his campaign did not clarify that point to PolitiFact. The bill that passed the House did not have a mechanism for regional variations. Biden said Trump \"thinks that $15 an hour minimum wage is too much for essential workers.\" Trump has expressed skepticism about a $15 minimum wage in the past, and his administration issued clear opposition to a $15 minimum wage bill that passed the House in 2019. However, in the debate held just a few days before Biden\u2019s comment, Trump did say that he\u2019d \"consider it to an extent \u2026 in a second administration.\" Trump never spoke about people not deserving a wage, and he never specifically mentioned essential workers. His concern was that minimum wage increases could lead to job losses. We rate Biden\u2019s statement Half True.

        "claim": "\"Mike Parson opposes protections for pre-existing conditions.\u201d",
        "doc": "With the Affordable Care Act under fire from Republicans, protections for pre-existing conditions have become a big issue in the 2020 election. Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway, who is running to replace Gov. Mike Parson in the Nov. 3 election, has repeatedly said Republicans have no plan to prevent health insurance companies from denying coverage or raising rates for people with pre-existing health conditions, such as cancer survivors or those with diabetes. She\u2019s also leveled this attack against Parson specifically. In a Sept. 26 campaign ad, she said, \"Mike Parson opposes protections for pre-existing conditions.\" We reached out to the Galloway campaign and were told that the core of their argument is based on Parson-appointed Attorney General Eric Schmitt\u2019s efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act through a lawsuit. A critical part of the Affordable Care Act includes protections for pre-existing conditions. Republicans, including Parson, have made no secret that they oppose the Affordable Care Act. But they say he doesn\u2019t oppose protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions. The Parson campaign pointed us to a legislative proposal dated Dec. 10, 2019. Parson\u2019s proposal called for legislation that \"prohibits health insurance plans from imposing a pre-existing condition exclusion.\" After providing us with the proposal, the Parson campaign did not respond to follow-up questions. This proposal became Senate Bill 970, sponsored by state Sen. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia. An identical counterpart was filed in the House. The bill has caveats, though. It only keeps these protections in place \"until such time as the General Assembly specifically provides otherwise\" and nowhere in the bill are the words \"pre-existing conditions.\" Neither bill ever made it to the floor of either chamber. One legal scholar who specializes in public health law and has studied the Affordable Care Act extensively said that he doesn\u2019t think any state law could replace the act\u2019s protections. \"If you pass a state-level law saying you have to cover pre-existing conditions, it will nevertheless be the case, without the Affordable Care Act, that there will be no coverage for pre-existing conditions,\" said Sam Halabi, law professor at the University of Missouri. He said the issue is with people who can\u2019t get health care from an employer and have to purchase individual policies. Before the Affordable Care Act, employer-provided policies generally didn\u2019t exclude pre-existing conditions. But without the ACA, if health insurers were forced to cover pre-existing conditions in individual policies, they\u2019d simply stop offering individual policies or raise rates to unreasonable levels. The proposed bill would prevent them from raising prices for people with pre-existing conditions, but it would not prevent them from raising prices on all individual policies across the board. \"I say that based on what insurers did before the Affordable Care Act,\" Halabi said. \"What happened pre-ACA was that insurers generally just wouldn\u2019t offer individual policies in the state... or they would price them out of reach.\" If the Affordable Care Act were struck down and the state law were in place, he believes this same thing would happen again. \"I think the best way to interpret this,\" Halabi said, \"is that by submitting this, both on the governor\u2019s point and on Caleb Rowden\u2019s, for them, they can plausibly say to voters, \u2018oh, but we\u2019ve offered something to put in place of the federal law,\u2019 but what will happen is that if (the Affordable Care Act) gets struck down, insurers will no longer offer those policies in this state, so it won\u2019t do anybody any good.\" Nicole Galloway said, \"Mike Parson opposes protections for pre-existing conditions.\" Parson has made it clear that he opposes the Affordable Care Act, which protects Americans with pre-existing conditions. At the same time, like other Republicans, he has said he supports the protections for pre-existing condition coverage. He backed a state law intended to protect pre-existing conditions if the Affordable Care Act were overturned. But that bill never made it out of committee, and a legal scholar says the legislation wouldn\u2019t work \u2014insurers would simply stop offering individual policies at affordable prices, leaving people without employer-provided insurance no way to get coverage. Parson may say that he likes the idea of protections for pre-existing conditions, but he has done nothing to put in place effective, clear legislation that will provide these protections. And by supporting a lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act, he has taken steps to overturn a federal law that already protects people with pre-existing conditions.

        "claim": "Says Dan Forest has \u201cmissed almost half of the Board of Education meetings during the pandemic.\"",
        "doc": "Lt. Governor Dan Forest thinks he would be a better governor than Roy Cooper. But Cooper says Forest hasn\u2019t put in the work needed to hold the office. The two went at it on Oct. 14 in North Carolina\u2019s lone gubernatorial debate. \"The Lieutenant Governor is on the state board of education where the state opening plans are discussed and voted on. And while I\u2019m working with them and public health officials, he\u2019s missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic,\" Cooper said. Forest responded by saying \"I\u2019ve been to almost every one of those meetings, especially every voting meeting. My staff sits in. My education experts and advisors sit in on all of those meetings, we don\u2019t miss a beat on an education meeting. We never have. We\u2019ve always been present at all of them.\" So what\u2019s the truth here? We\u2019ll rate Cooper\u2019s statement, since he\u2019s the one bringing up the subject as an attack. He said Forest has missed almost half of North Carolina\u2019s education board meetings during the pandemic. As it turns out, Cooper\u2019s claim is almost spot-on. The Board of Education has not uploaded its meeting minutes since March. So we listened to audio files uploaded to YouTube. Then we asked the North Carolina Department of Instruction for attendance records. Cooper declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus on March 10, so we\u2019re using that as the start date for the pandemic in North Carolina. There have been 28 meetings since then, according to Deanna Townsend-Smith, DPI\u2019s director of board operations and policy. Most of them were over an hour long, meaning the board has spent well over 24 hours talking about education policy just in the last eight months. Forest has missed 13 of the 28 meetings, or 46%. Forest missed meetings on March 18 and 27. He attended five meetings in a row before missing seven out of 10 from the beginning of May to the end of July. He then missed four in a row between Sept. 3 and Oct. 7. In some cases, Forest arrived late to meetings but was still counted present. \"Present does not always mean attendance for the entire meeting, but present at some point and time,\" Townsend-Smith said. It\u2019s unclear why Forest missed the meetings. Neither his office nor his campaign responded to questions from PolitiFact this week. Forest said during the debate that his experts and advisors \"sit in on all\" of the meetings. Staff members can\u2019t vote. And Townsend-Smith told PolitiFact that board members \"cannot have anyone attend the meeting on their behalf.\" Forest \"may have had someone listening to the meeting on his behalf,\" she said, adding \"however that is not something that is within my purview and you would need to verify that with the LG\u2019s office.\" Forest has downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, saying the state should reopen schools without a mask mandate. DPI\u2019s records show Forest missed votes that made changes to grading, testing and graduation requirements, set guidelines for remote learning, as well as another vote on grade point averages. Cooper said Forest has \"missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic.\" We\u2019re not here to say whether or not Forest should have attended the meetings. However, we can say whether Cooper\u2019s stat is correct. The state Department of Instruction says Forest has missed 13 of 28 meetings since the pandemic started. That means he\u2019s missed 46% of the meetings. That\u2019s close enough to \"half\" for us. We rate Cooper\u2019s claim is True.",

        "doc": "In a Halloween-day pitch to voters in Flint, Mich., former Vice President Joe Biden slammed President Donald Trump over the New York Times\u2019 reporting on his long-concealed tax returns, which revealed that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in both 2017 and 2016. \"Why should you pay more in taxes than Donald Trump?\" Biden said at the event with former President Barack Obama. \"He paid $750 in taxes the one year we know of. He\u2019s yet to release. I\u2019ve released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and look. He hasn\u2019t released one.\" \"He talks about corruption,\" Biden continued. \"What is he hiding?\" The Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s 22-years claim is accurate. He has made it before, including ahead of the first presidential debate, when he made public his 2019 tax returns. The American people deserve transparency from their leaders, it's why as of today, I've released 22 years of my tax returns. https://t.co/6fwL20fWeI The Biden campaign website lists Biden\u2019s federal and state tax returns for 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. It also lists Biden\u2019s financial disclosure documents for 2020 and 2019 and the 2019 tax returns for his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and her husband. The returns show Biden and his wife, Jill, paid nearly $288,000 in federal income taxes in 2019. RELATED: Biden\u2019s income sources aren\u2019t such a big mystery Biden\u2019s tax returns for the previous eight years, covering the rest of his two terms as Obama\u2019s vice president, can be found in archived press releases from the Obama White House. Those included tax returns released for 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Asked for the remaining 10 years\u2019 worth of filings, the Biden campaign pointed to an archived Q&A from Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign website, which linked to many years of Biden\u2019s tax returns from his decades-long stint as a U.S. senator representing Delaware. The page included tax returns from 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998. The 22 years of Bidentax returns are also available as part of an archive maintained by Tax Notes. Trump has not released his tax returns, breaking a promise he made during his 2016 campaign. According to the New York Times, the former real estate mogul and reality TV star has vowed for nearly a decade to release his tax returns under different conditions, but he hasn\u2019t delivered. Trump is the only president or major-party presidential nominee in decades to keep his returns hidden from the public. Efforts by Congress and others to get hold of them have so far been unsuccessful. Trump has cited a pending Internal Revenue Service audit as reason for not publishing his tax returns. The IRS, however, has said nothing precludes a president from releasing tax returns while under audit \u2014 as President Richard Nixon did. Trump has also claimed, falsely, that his financial disclosures offer a more extensive picture of his finances. In recent years, the New York Times has obtained tax records and pieced together a more complete picture of Trump\u2019s tax history. In September, the Times reported that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in both 2017 and 2016, and none at all in several years before that. Trump has provided no evidence to suggest that he\u2019s paid more in taxes than the Times found. Tax experts said the complex tax history depicted by the Times report shows unusually aggressive tax avoidance and exceptionally persistent losses. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Biden said, \"I\u2019ve released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and look. (Donald Trump) hasn\u2019t released one.\" Biden\u2019s federal tax returns from 2019 dating back to 1998 are available online, as he claimed. The most recent returns are highlighted on his campaign website. Others can be found on the websites for the Obama White House and the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. Trump has not publicly released his tax returns, making him the only president or major-party presidential nominee in decades who has not done so. We rate Biden\u2019s claim True.

        "claim": "When Sen. Kelly Loeffler heard about the COVID-19 risk, she \u201cfocused on her own portfolio\u201d and \"profited from the pandemic.\"",
        "doc": "The Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat and first-time candidate running to unseat Georgia GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, accused her of using her position to profit from the coronavirus outbreak. \"We have a United States senator, Kelly Loeffler, unelected by the people of Georgia who, when she heard about COVID-19 seemed much more focused on her own portfolio than the people she was sent there to represent,\" Warnock said on MSNBC. \"She profited from the pandemic.\" Warnock was referring to ethics complaints about questionable stock trades by Loeffler and other senators after an early briefing about the coronavirus threat. Financial disclosures and news reports show that on the day of the briefing and in the weeks afterward, Loeffler\u2019s accounts engaged in various stock trades involving companies that would be affected by a disease outbreak, and some of those trades helped her make profits, or avert big losses. Loeffler has denied using nonpublic information to benefit financially, and a Senate Ethics Committee investigation found no evidence that Loeffler violated any laws or Senate rules. Warnock is the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached. Warnock is among 21 candidates competing to fill the seat held by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned in December with health problems. Loeffler, an Atlanta businesswoman, was appointed on an interim basis. If no candidate gets at least 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff Jan. 5. The race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It\u2019s rated a tossup by the Cook Political Report. So is Georgia\u2019s other Senate contest, which pits Republican incumbent David Perdue against Democrat Jon Ossoff. Loeffler\u2019s stock trades during the period before the potential threat of the virus became widely known surfaced in news stories early in the pandemic, and crystallized with complaints made to the Senate Ethics Committee that targeted several other senators as well. Here\u2019s a timeline, based on the complaints and news reports: Jan. 24: Loeffler attended a private briefing for senators from administration officials about \"an emerging public health threat\" posed by the novel coronavirus, just three days after the first case in the United States had been confirmed. Jan. 24 - Feb. 14: Loeffler and her husband made more than 20 stock sales amounting to between $1.275 million and $3.1 million. Loeffler also bought stock in two companies, including Citrix, which produces teleworking software. Feb. 14: The stock market began a tumble that would take the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 36% over the next five weeks. (It recouped most of those losses over the next several months.) Feb. 26 - March 11: $18.7 million in shares of Intercontinental Exchange stock were sold on Loeffler\u2019s behalf in three separate deals, among other trades from mid-February to mid-March, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported in April. Loeffler is a former executive with the company, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, is the CEO. March 13: President Donald Trump declared a national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak as shutdowns began across the country. March 20: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, filed a complaint asking the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate Loeffler and another GOP senator, Richard Burr of North Carolina. Another government watchdog group, Common Cause, filed similar complaints against those two and two other senators, Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma. The CREW complaint alleged that Loeffler violated insider trading laws and the STOCK Act, which bars members of Congress from using nonpublic information for private profit. June 16: The Senate Ethics Committee dismissed its investigation into Loeffler, saying it \"did not find evidence\" that she violated the law or Senate rules. It did not elaborate. The Department of Justice had also conducted a probe, but closed it in May with no action. Days after the Journal Constitution report, Loeffler announced that she and her husband would divest themselves of all individual stocks and move their money into mutual and exchange-traded funds. \"I have never used any confidential information I received while performing my Senate duties as a means of making a private profit, she said then. \"Nor has anyone in my family.\" Loeffler campaign communications director Stephen Lawson told PolitiFact that Loeffler and her husband had no role in the transactions. \"She had no knowledge, no control, no communication, none of that\" with the \"third-party advisers\" who handled all of the transactions, he said. Lawson said Loeffler ultimately lost $1.3 million in the \"liquidation\" of her stocks. Asked for information to support Warnock\u2019s attack, his campaign highlighted a number of Loeffler transactions, citing news reports and Senate disclosure reports made by Loeffler. The transactions involved shares of companies that were affected by changes brought on by the pandemic. Some examples: Loeffler and her husband bought stock in Citrix on Feb. 14 and sold it on April 7, creating a gain of $33,285. On Feb. 14, Loeffler sold between $250,001 and $500,000 worth of stock in Exxon Mobil from an account owned jointly with her husband, avoiding losses that would occur as the outbreak took hold. The stock then was trading at around $60 per share; by the end of March, it had tumbled to about $31. Between Feb. 28 and March 10, Loeffler\u2019s husband purchased $206,774 worth of stock in DuPont de Nemours, which produces protective suits used by health care workers. Warnock claimed Loeffler \"focused on her own portfolio\" after hearing about the COVID-19 threat and \"profited from the pandemic,\" suggesting that she used non-public information about the coronavirus outbreak to make beneficial stock trades. Loeffler denied using inside information, and Senate Ethics Committee and Justice Department investigations found she did not violate laws or Senate rules barring insider trading. Her disclosures and other news reports show that on the day she received a private coronavirus briefing and in the weeks weeks afterward, there were stock trades made on her behalf involving companies that would be affected by the pandemic, and she benefited from those trades.

        "claim": "Farm bankruptcies are \"at an eight-year high.\"",
        "doc": "Theresa Greenfield stepped up to the podium in Des Moines, Iowa, at a Friday rally for fellow Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden the weekend before the contentious 2020 campaign for control of the White House and Congress and talked about Iowans\u2019 toughness. \"You know, Iowans are going through really tough times right now, and I think these are going to be some of the most consequential times of our life, with the pandemic, the recent derecho, farm bankruptcies at an eight-year high\u2026,\" Greenfield told those who gathered for the Oct. 30 coronavirus-eradrive-up rally. We\u2019ve touched on the farm economypreviouslyand have heard the bankruptcy comments before from Democrats who want to paint a bleak picture of the economy, which wasmoving forwardbefore the coronavirus pandemic disrupted it. The Greenfield campaign says it relied on aReuters news reportfor its information but other news organizations also have reported the trend. An independent check of the U.S. Courts\u2019 most recentreporton bankruptcy cases shows 595 bankruptcies filed in 2019 under Chapter 12, which covers family farms. That is up from 498 in 2018 and 501 in 2017. You have to go back to 2011, when637 family farm bankruptcieswere filed under Chapter 12, for a higher number than what the courts system reported for 2019. We should note that, although Greenfield uses the statistic to paint a negative picture of Republicans in control of the presidency and Senate, a Democrat was in the White House in 2011. Greenfield lifts the statistic about farm bankruptcies from federal records and reporting about those records when making campaign statements about the farm economy. This is pretty straightforward. We rate her claim to be True. This fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Clickhere, for more. ",

        "claim": "Says Joni Ernst \"supports the lawsuit that's headed to the Supreme Court that will\u201d repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
        "doc": "The Affordable Care Act has become a flashpoint in this year\u2019s battle for the U.S. Senate seat from Iowa. Democratic candidate Theresa Greenfield has honed in on Republican Sen. Joni Ernst\u2019s past votes to repeal and replace the ACA, while Ernst has been adamant that she supports people with preexisting conditions. Inan Oct. 22 tweet, Greenfield again criticized Ernst\u2019s record on health care. \"She\u2019s voted repeatedly to repeal the ACA, and now she supports the lawsuit that\u2019s headed to the Supreme Court that will do just that,\" Greenfield tweeted. Greenfield and Democrats have been critical of the lawsuit, and Greenfield hascalled on Ernst to publicly oppose it. A look at congressional records shows Ernst has cast multiple votes to repeal the ACA, and similar claims have been vetted byother fact-checkers. But here, we\u2019re focusing on Greenfield\u2019s second claim \u2014 that Ernst supports the lawsuit coming up in the Supreme Court that could invalidate the Affordable Care Act. The lawsuit Greenfield referenceschallengesthe ACA\u2019s constitutionality and is under appeal in the caseCalifornia v. Texas. A mandate that required most people to have some level of health insurance or face a penalty tax was zeroed out in theTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Twenty states, represented by Texas, are suing the federal government, arguing the mandate is not constitutional and the whole law should be struck down. Iowa is one of 20 states and the District of Columbia that are defending the ACA. Democratic Attorney General Tom Millerjoined the defense on appealin February 2019. The Supreme Court is to hear oral arguments in the case soon after the election, on Nov. 10. Ernst has not expressed a hard position on the lawsuit during this year\u2019s campaign and has declined to say whether or not she supports or opposes it, saying the decision is up to the courts. \"We\u2019ll see what the decision is. But that\u2019s in the court\u2019s hands,\" Ernsttold Politico in September. When we contacted the Greenfield campaign for evidence to back up its claim that Ernst supports the lawsuit, staffers said that Ernst\u2019s history of opposing the ACA, her lack of a stance on the lawsuit, and her vote to cut the individual mandate are all signs that she supports the lawsuit. \"There\u2019s absolutely no doubt that Senator Ernst supports the ongoing anti-ACA lawsuit,\" campaign spokesperson Izzi Levy wrote in an email toPolitifact.\"\u2026In fact, Theresa even called on Senator Ernst to oppose this harmful lawsuit on the first day of the general election. But since then, Ernst has consistently refused to speak out or take any meaningful action to stop it.\" Ernst has a history of antagonism against the ACA. She campaigned in 2014 on repealing the law. Shevoted for three measures to replace the ACAin 2017 and also votedto begin debate on a billthat would have eliminated the provision that prevents insurers from dropping coverage for people with preexisting conditions. Two years earlier,she votedto approve the fiscal 2016 federal budget thatincluded provisionsfor adjustments tied to repealing the ACA. She has criticized the law throughout the 2020 campaign, saying itcaused health care prices to go up. Ernst has been more careful in her recent criticism and votes related to the ACA. On Oct. 1, shevoted with Democrats on a bid to blockthe U.S. Justice Department from supporting the lawsuit. She was one of six Republican senators who crossed the party line, all of them vulnerable from Democratic challengers in the fall election.Ernst saidher vote showed her support for protecting people who have preexisting conditions. The vote was called symbolic by bothPoliticoandtheWashington Post, and itwas seenby political opponents and some political analysts as a decision from Republicans in competitive elections to avoid backlash. While it signals opposition and prevents Ernst\u2019s opponents from having another point to attack her on, it doesn\u2019t show that Ernst opposes the lawsuit itself. The lawsuit would have continued whether or not it had backing from the Justice Department because the department is not part of the original lawsuit orruling. When asked whether Ernst supports or opposes the lawsuit, campaign spokesperson Brendan Conley said she hasn\u2019t taken a position on it. \"Joni has made clear that this is being taken up by the courts and that her focus is on taking Iowans\u2019 fight to Congress to ensure we maintain protections for those with preexisting conditions,\" Conley wrote in an email toPolitiFact. Ernst alsosupported the lawthat ultimately led to the lawsuit. The 2017 Republican-led Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the penalty from the individual mandate, set the ground for the constitutionality of the law to be challenged. Ernst has continued to promote the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the campaign trail in 2020. Greenfield said that Ernst supports the lawsuit striking down the Affordable Care Act. But Ernst has failed to give a clear, publicly stated stance on the lawsuit. Greenfield\u2019s claim is based on Ernst\u2019s consistently critical assessment of the ACA and votes in favor of repealing the law. Ernst also voted to cut the individual mandate, which led to the law being challenged in court. Even though Ernst hasn\u2019t taken a position on the lawsuit itself, she\u2019s expressed a repeated desire to roll back the ACA. We rate Greenfield\u2019s claim Half True.",

        "claim": "Congressional benefits include \u201cfree health care, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days.\u201d",
        "doc": "Facebook users are recirculating an old post that accuses members of Congress of enjoying more luxurious employment benefits than their constituents do. \"Take a look at the congressional benefits,\" says the Oct. 10, 2019, Facebook post, which was shared thousands of times. \"Free health care, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days; now THAT\u2019S welfare.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post mirrors other claims PolitiFact has fact-checked about lawmaker salaries, which haven\u2019t increased since 2009, and retirement benefits. We reached out to Demian Brady, director of research at the National Taxpayers Union, and Mark Strand, president of the Congressional Institute, to understand what benefits actually come with a seat in Congress. \"A lot of this stuff is an exaggeration,\" Strand said of the Facebook post. The Facebook post claims lawmakers get \"free health care,\" but Brady said their coverage would be better described as \"highly subsidized.\" It\u2019s not free. Members of Congress are eligible to get insurance through DC Health Link, the exchange marketplace for Washington, D.C., under the Affordable Care Act. The FAQ page on DC Health Link\u2019s website lists \"members of Congress\" among its eligible recipients. The federal government kicks in 72% of the premium costs, Brady said. That lines up with what the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in a 2017 report. \"They get subsidized just like every federal employee,\" Strand said, adding that members can also opt to get coverage through a spouse\u2019s employer-based insurance if they prefer. For comparison, employers in the U.S. contributed, on average, roughly 71% of the premium for family coverage and roughly 83% of the premium for single coverage in 2020, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s annual survey of private and non-federal public employers. Whether congressional retirement benefits are \"outrageous,\" as the Facebook post claims, is a matter of opinion. But they are \"generous compared to the private sector,\" Brady said. Members of Congress \u2014 save for the few elected prior to 1984 \u2014 belong to a pension program known as the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System. The program is available to every federal employee, not just lawmakers, as PolitiFact previously reported. And it augments other benefits available to seniors. \"They do pay Medicare, just like every other American,\" Strand said. \"They do pay into Social Security, and they do have this federal retirement.\" The FERS program qualifies members for a pension after five years of service, with previous work as a federal employee counting toward the vesting period. Those lawmakers must contribute part of their congressional salary into the pension plan in order to be eligible for the benefit. To collect, the lawmaker must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of federal service, or be any age with 25 years of service. The size of a lawmaker\u2019s pension depends on several factors, including the length of their service. But Brady said the pension for eligible members pays two to three times more than pensions offered to similarly-salaried workers in the private sector. In the private sector, about 67% of workers have access to defined-benefit or defined-contribution retirement plans, and about 51% participate, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Facebook post claims that members of Congress get \"67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, (and) unlimited paid sick days.\" That\u2019s misleading. The 2021 legislative calendar listed by House Majority Steny Hoyer, D-Md., includes only 10 federal holidays that all federal employees get off \u2014 not 67. Defining vacation days, meanwhile, is tricky. Members of Congress split time between Washington and their homes states or districts, and they may still be working during recess periods, so time away from Washington shouldn\u2019t be confused with vacation, Strand said. \"There is no provision for vacation days,\" Brady added. \"When Congress is not in session, members often work in their districts, but they make their own schedules.\" As for sick days, members can take time off when they are sick or for other reasons. As PolitiFact has reported, members who are absent from votes often enter statements in the Congressional Record to reflect how they would have voted if they had been present. (Since May and throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the House has used a proxy voting system that lets absent members authorize a colleague to cast their vote for them.) There\u2019s no limit on sick days or time off for members, Brady said, noting that former Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois missed the better part of a year after suffering a stroke in 2012. \"Usually when people are running for president, they don\u2019t show up for Congress at all, for months on end,\" Strand said. Private industry workers get an average of eight paid holidays, seven paid sick leave days and 11 paid vacation days per year after one year of work, according to a March 2020 Bureau of Labor Statistics report. A Facebook post said congressional benefits include \"free health care, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days.\" The post gets more details wrong than right. Lawmakers can take absences when they are sick, and they do have generous pension plans. But they do not get free health care, and they do not take 67 paid holidays. There isn\u2019t a provision governing their vacation days, either. We\u2019ll rate this post Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d",
        "doc": "A conservative commentator known for his support of former President Donald Trump attacked the Biden administration over its role overseeing the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. \"The Biden Administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines\u2026 This entire administration is a joke,\" tweeted Ryan Fournier, founder of the group Students for Trump. As evidence, Fournier linked to an article published on the RFAngle, a site of conservative commentary that he founded. Fournier\u2019s claim is misleading. There\u2019s a difference between losing vaccines and looking for them. Politico was the first news outlet to break the story that the Biden administration was trying to locate 20 million missing vaccines. After Biden was sworn in, Politico reported, his COVID-19 response team discovered that the distribution system established by the Trump administration failed to track the full route the vaccines traveled once they left the federal government\u2019s storage spaces. As a result, there was a large gap between the number of vaccines that had been sent out by the federal government and the number that had actually been administered. Politico\u2019s reporting made clear that the Trump administration had set up the distribution infrastructure under which the 20 million missing doses had gone missing. \"That\u2019s a dilemma that predated the Biden team\u2019s arrival,\" Politico noted. The RFAngle article that Fournier linked to in his tweet is critical of Biden but does not directly claim that the Biden team lost the vaccines. \"Biden administration cannot find 20 million vaccine doses,\" reads the headline. Daniel Baldwin, the author of the RFAngle article, told PolitiFact that he based his piece on the Politico report. We reached out to Fournier and asked for evidence to back up his claim. In response to our email, Mark Chase at RFAngle responded with a link to the Politico article and a NY Post article that drew on Politico\u2019s reporting. When PolitiFact pointed to the language in the Politico article that contradicts Fournier\u2019s claim, Chase told us that RFAngle had corrected its piece to clarify that the loss of the doses predated the Biden administration. \"The vaccines were dispatched by the federal government to state governments prior to President Biden taking office. The Biden Administration is making efforts to locate them,\" the correction reads. Ryan Fournier claimed that \"the Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" The Biden administration didn\u2019t lose those doses. The Trump administration set up the distribution infrastructure under which these vaccines went missing. The article that Fournier linked to as evidence has been corrected to include this information. Fournier\u2019s claim is False.\u200b",

        "claim": "Facebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
        "doc": "A conservative blog falsely claimed Facebook tried to \"shut down\" the campaign to recall Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom when the social media company stopped running political advertisements. In reality, Facebook stopped accepting political ads regardless of party affiliation last fall to curb misinformation. No one campaign was singled out. In mid-December, the company made an exception to the ban when it allowed ads in the three weeks leading up to the U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia and then resumed the ban last month. Still, RedState.org published an article Jan. 28 with the headline: \"Facebook Says No More Ads for Movement To Recall Gavin Newsom.\" The Newsom recall campaign shared the blog on its Instagram account early this week. Randy Economy, a spokesperson for the recall campaign, said he would review the post but did not respond to questions about why the campaign shared it. The article in question includes a subheadline visible on social media that claims Facebook is \"Attempting to shut down a fully legal recall effort because \u2026 cronyism?\" It offers no evidence for that allegation. A screen shot of the RedState.com article and claim. This post was flagged as part of PolitiFact's partnership with Facebook to fact-check false news on the social media platform. However, Facebook played no role in selecting the fact check or its rating. Our Research Along with making the claim about shutting down the recall, the RedState.com article goes on to allege Mark Zukerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive officer, \"has sought out to silence dissent against his comrades in the Democrat party,\" following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by Trump extremists. Following the insurrection, Facebook blocked content posted to the #StormTheCapitol hashtag, according to a TechCrunch article. The article went on to say that Facebook representatives pledged to remove content praising the Trump supporters who infiltrated the U.S. Capitol as well as any other \"incitement or encouragement\" of the events, including photos and videos from the individuals\u2019 perspectives. Still, Devon Kearns, a Facebook spokesperson, wrote in an email that last year\u2019s decision to pause political ads had nothing to do with the Newsom recall campaign. \"If they are unable to run ads relating to recalling Newsom, it is because of the ban on ads about social issues, elections or politics that has now been in place for over two months,\" he wrote. The ban does not prevent political campaigns from publishing \"organic\" posts, or non-paid content. It means they can\u2019t pay to post advertisements which are boosted by Facebook\u2019s advertising algorithms and shared across the platform, including to those who do not follow the recall campaign. Here\u2019s how Zuckerberg explained his decision to stop running ads last year. \"It's important that campaigns can run get out the vote campaigns, and I generally believe the best antidote to bad speech is more speech, but in the final days of an election there may not be enough time to contest new claims,\" he wrote in a September 2020 Facebook post. Despite the pause on Facebook ads, the recall campaign maintains a strong presence on the social media platform, including a public group where nearly 21,000 members share information about upcoming recall drives along with news and opinion articles about the governor. It has another 16,000 followers on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and more than 10,000 followers on Twitter. In recent months, the recall effort has gained momentum as Newsom\u2019s administration has struggled to control numerous health and economic crises, most recently the slow distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. More than one-third of California voters, or 36%, support recalling Newsom, while 45% are opposed, according to a UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies survey released this week. To qualify the recall for a future ballot, the campaign must submit approximately 1.5 million signatures of registered voters to county elections officials by March 17, all of which must be verified. Proponents say they have gathered more than 1.3 million signatures. Last month, California Democratic Party Chairman Rusty Hicks described the effort to recall Newsom as \"the California coup.\" We rated that ridiculous claim Pants on Fire. A coup is a violent overthrow of a government. A recall is a legally sanctioned effort to vote an elected official out of office midway through their term. It\u2019s been part of California\u2019s constitution for more than a century. Conservatives have expressed distrust in Facebook and other social media companies, alleging they censor or diminish right-wing political speech. Facebook, Twitter and a host of other companies banned President Donald Trump from their platforms last month after he encouraged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and to march to the Capitol. Shortly after, a mob of extremists assaulted police officers and breached the building in a riot that left five people dead, including one U.S. Capitol police officer. Our Ruling A conservative blog alleged Facebook tried to \"shut down\" the campaign to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom by refusing to run its advertisements. That\u2019s not what happened. Facebook stopped accepting political ads regardless of party last fall to slow false information on its platform, though it made an exception by allowing ads to run in the U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia before resuming the ban. It did not single out the recall campaign, which maintains a strong presence on Facebook and has gained momentum in recent months. The blog misleads with the headline, \"Facebook Says No More Ads for Movement To Recall Gavin Newsom.\" The subheadline goes further with the unsubstantiated and outlandish allegation that Facebook tried to \"shut down\" the recall campaign altogether. We rate that claim False. FALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.",

        "claim": "Insulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"",
        "doc": "More than 7 millionAmericans require insulin to treat their diabetes but some people struggle to afford the cost. On Jan. 14, 2021, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tweeted, \"2day Sen Wyden & I released Finance Cmte report on INSULIN costs Prices hv gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices They make $$ as % of ballooning list price so no incentive to lower price on 100 yr old drug.\" Grassley has a history ofattempting throughproposed legislationtolower the costof the drug, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon,worked with himas the ranking minority member on the Senate Finance Committee when Republicans controlled the Senate. Is Grassley right when he tweets about why insulin costs so much? To answer that question, we look, first, at those costs. Insulin costs the people who use it a lot, aswehavereportedon in thepast. Between 2012 and 2016, the drug\u2019s cost nearly doubled, although some priceshave declined slightlyin the past few years. Goodrx.com, an online company that reports on drug prices as part of a discounting business,reportsthat, in 2020, consumers could buy a generic insulin lispro KwikPen for $60, compared to the name-brand Humalog KwikPen for $140. Insulin remains expensive even when its price drops. Although a Humalog 50/50 vial has decreased slightly in price, one vial still costs an average of $390.23, the Goodrx web listing shows. Depending on the pharmacy and anysavingsfoundonline, customers could end up paying more or less than that average. David Tridgell, a Minneapolisendocrinologistwho has had Type 1 diabetes since he was 15, wrote inThe Washington Postin 2017 that patients with Type 1 diabetes tend to use two or three vials of insulin per month. At the current cost of one vial of Humalog 50/50, these patients would spend $780 to $1,170 on their insulin every month. Type 2 Diabetes patients can require even more insulin per month, sometimes requiring six or more vials, Tridgell wrote. This would add up to $2,341 or more every month. Grassley claims that the increase is tied to the business practices of manufacturers, health plans and PBMs,orpharmacy benefitmanagers. An April 10, 2019, House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing titled,\"Priced Out of a Lifesaving Drug: Getting Answers on the Rising Cost of Insulin,\"featured testimony from CVS Health, Express Scripts, OptumRx, Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi. They couldn\u2019t lower the prices of insulin, the company representatives claimed, because of how PBMs and health insurance companies operate. PBMs serve as a liaison between drug companies and health insurance companies, negotiating what insurance companies, pharmacies and patients pay for a drug.PBMs and insurance companies help to determine on which tier of theformularythe drug will be placed.They can negotiate rebates, discounts, and other services.These rebates and other benefits are passed on to the health plans.Medicare, the government funded insurance program for seniors,is barred from participating in these negotiations. Astudypublished by the American Diabetes Association in 2018 showed that these negotiations encourage high list prices. As these list prices increase, \"profits of the intermediaries in the insulin supply chain, such as wholesalers, PBMs and pharmacies, increase because each may receive a rebate, discount or fee calculated as a percentage of the list price.\" The study also reported that, because transparency is lacking within the insulin supply chain, \"it is unclear precisely how the dollars flow and how much each intermediary profits.\" Some insulin producers blame insulin\u2019s prices on the cost of innovation. However, Mayo Clinic hematologist S. Vincent Rajkumar dismissed this claim in apaperpublished by Mayo Clinic in January 2020. Rajkumar wrote that limited innovation exists when it comes to insulin, and that what matters more is affordability. This sentiment was echoed in the April 2019 House hearing when Rep. Mckinley (R-West Virginia) said, \"Innovation is supposed to drive prices down, not up.\" The bipartisan United States Senate Finance Committee staff report,\"Insulin: Examining the Factors Driving the Rising Cost of a Century Old Drug,\"that was released Jan. 14, 2021, stated, \"Eli Lilly reported spending $395 million on R&D costs for Humalog, Humulin, and Basaglar between 2014 and 2018, during which time the company spent nearly $1.5 billion on sales and marketing expenses for its insulins.\" The report also citedinstancesof 100-year-old drugs still going up in price. Every time a pharmacy dispenses therapeutic insulin, manufacturers pay PBMs administrative fees as high as 5 percent of the drug\u2019s wholesale acquisition cost, the Senate staff report states. \"These fees are a significant revenue stream for PBMs and likely act as a countervailing force against lower list prices\u2014PBMs may be reluctant to push for lower WAC prices since it would reduce their administrative fee-based revenue,\" the report stated. Grassley said that insulin prices have dramatically increased because of manufacturer, health plan, and pharmacy benefit manager practices. He\u2019s right.Innovations alone aren\u2019t enough to justify the extreme increases in price that have raised insulin costs over the years. PBMs, with their complicated discount negotiations; and manufacturers, with their continuing drive to increase earnings, both play a role. So do drug stores, pharmacies, and other suppliers who want to be competitive in the marketplace by offering consumers discounts. But the discounts don\u2019t go to everyone with diabetes, and when they do, they vary from vendor to vendor. Multiple studies in recent years, testimony in public hearings, the drug\u2019s pricing history, and sourcing in federal government reports show examples of complicated procedures related in large part to negotiated discounts for some vendors adding to overall insulin costs. We rate Grassley\u2019s statement True. CORRECTION: Aprevious version of this article incorrectly stated that the acronym PBM stood for pharmacy business manager;it is pharmacy benefit manager.",

        "claim": "\u201cDonald Trump is the first president in modern history (who) did not start a new war.\u201d",
        "doc": "When President Donald Trump came into office, the U.S. was still struggling to extricate itself from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that had begun more than a decade earlier. When he left, U.S. troop levels in both countries were sharply lower. And some of Trump\u2019s supporters praised him for not starting any new wars. His son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted Jan. 22 that \"Donald Trump is the first president in modern history (who) did not start a new war.\" Trump himself echoed this claim in his last address at the White House, saying that he was the first president \"in decades\" not to start a war. After Trump Jr. made his post, many users pushed back on his claim by citing Jimmy Carter, who was president from 1977 to 1981, didn\u2019t start any wars and is still alive. We tried to contact Donald Trump Jr. through the Trump Organization to find out what he meant, but didn\u2019t get a response. We also reached out to six experts on U.S. military and foreign policy and asked them whether the former president deserves such a distinction. They said the answer depends on which presidents are considered \"modern,\" and how you define war. But all of them agreed that the claim leaves out key context and paints a misleading portrait of the Trump administration\u2019s use of military force. The United States has formally declared war in only five conflicts: the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II. A definition of war that rested on a formal declaration by Congress would leave out conflicts such as the Vietnam War, the Korean War and the Iraq War, said Joseph DeThomas, a professor at the Penn State School of International Affairs. These later conflicts began under an \"authorization of military force\" from Congress, giving the president powers to prosecute the war abroad. Trump never asked for such an authorization during his administration. However, neither did his predecessor, Barack Obama, who nonetheless oversaw sustained armed conflict in Afghanistan and spearheaded a NATO-backed intervention in Libya, for which he was criticized for not seeking congressional approval. Another approach, put forth by the Correlates of War Project, classifies a war as a conflict involving two organized armed forces that results in at least 1,000 battle-related casualties. By this definition, Trump did not start any wars, but neither did presidents Carter and Gerald Ford, said Robert Gulotty, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Chicago. Several experts we spoke with brought up Carter as the clearest example contradicting Trump Jr.\u2019s claim. Carter did not formally declare war on another country or seek authorization to use force from Congress. Nor did Carter engage U.S. armed forces in a new sustained armed conflict with another foreign power. Carter did oversee the U.S. response to the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis, and ordered a raid to try to free 52 American hostages held at the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The raid was aborted, though, and a helicopter that was to be part of the operation later crashed, killing eight U.S. servicemen. Carter \"was proud of claiming that there were no combat casualties on his watch until the aborted Iran rescue mission set him back,\" said Richard Betts, a professor of war and peace studies at Columbia University. \"But few would count that covert operation as starting a war.\" Historians differ on where to draw the boundaries of the modern era, but for this check involving both military and presidential history, we focus on the period since the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975 under Gerald Ford\u2019s presidency. Here\u2019s a look at some of the significant military actions initiated by U.S. presidents since that time: Ronald Reagan (1981-89): Under Reagan, 7,600 U.S. troops invaded Grenada and occupied the island within a few days; 19 American troops were killed during the operation. Reagan also sent soldiers into Lebanon in 1982 to participate in a temporary peacekeeping force, and later persuaded Congress to authorize an operation for 18 months. Around 250 Americans were killed before the U.S. withdrew its forces, most from a terrorist attack on U.S. marine barracks in Beirut. George H.W. Bush (1989-93): Bush initiated the Gulf War to expel the Iraqi army from Kuwait. More than 2 million U.S. service members served during the conflict, and 147 U.S. troops were killed in battle. Bill Clinton (1993-2001): Clinton dramatically increased the scope of a NATO intervention in the long-running civil war in Yugoslavia. After a series of NATO airstrikes in 1994, 60,000 U.S. and allied troops were deployed to Bosnia in 1995 as part of a \"peacekeeping mission.\" According to a 2016 retrospective from the military newspaper Stars & Stripes, no U.S. soldiers were killed in combat in Bosnia but several died from other causes. Under Clinton in 1999, NATO also participated in an intervention in Kosovo, during which two U.S. pilots died. Human Rights Watch estimated that as many as 527 civilians were killed in NATO airstrikes. George W. Bush (2001-09): After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan after the Taliban declined to extradite Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In 2003, U.S. forces invaded Iraq and ousted Saddam Hussein from power. According to the Defense Department, over 4,000 U.S. troops were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2010, and over 2,000 were killed in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. The Iraq Body Count Project has estimated that over 200,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed so far. American troops have remained stationed in both countries. Barack Obama (2009-17): Obama oversaw a NATO-backed intervention in Libya and a surge of troops into Afghanistan. After withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, Obama redeployed them in 2014 to combat territorial expansion by the Islamic State militia group. Trump didn\u2019t enter the U.S. into a fresh, sustained armed conflict with another state, or seek a new congressional authorization for use of force. He frequently criticized American involvement in the Middle East, and he took steps to withdraw U.S. troops from Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan before he left office. But Trump has used military force in other foreign countries under the broad authorization to use force granted after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. His administration has ordered airstrikes and drone attacks, supplemented allied militaries with U.S. troops, deployed special operations forces in the Middle East and beyond, and ordered the killing of Iran\u2019s Gen. Qassem Soleimani, which critics claim nearly triggered an armed conflict. \"With that authorization in place, I am not sure it is possible to start a new war these days,\" said DeThomas. \"They all fit under the legal umbrella of the old one.\" Stephanie Savell, a researcher at Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project, developed a map showing the scope of U.S. counterterrorism operations, including combat operations in the Middle East and across Africa. Many of these operations, Savell said, are carried out under Section 127e, a legal authority that allows U.S. special operations teams to organize and participate in raids on militant groups with foreign allies. The extent of the Trump administration\u2019s 127e programs, Politico has said, in effect constituted a secret U.S. war in African countries such as Kenya, Somalia, Mali and Niger. Donald Trump Jr. said in a tweet that \"Donald Trump is the first president in modern history (who) did not start a new war.\" Trump did not seek authorization from Congress for use of military force, or a formal declaration of war against any other country. He did not engage the U.S. in any new protracted conflicts during his four years in office. But Trump did order and oversee new military operations under existing authorizations, including counterterrorism raids that have spread to several countries in the Middle East and Africa. The claim also ignores the record of Carter, who did not start any new wars under the definitions put forward by military and foreign policy experts. As Carter is still alive, we consider him to be part of modern presidential and military history. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\u200b",

        "claim": "Says Joe Biden has \u201callowed males to compete in girls\u2019 sports.\u201d",
        "doc": "President Joe Biden issued a flurry of executive orders in his first days in office, and claims quickly followed about the results of those actions. One Facebook post read, \"In 36 hours Biden has disgraced our National Guard, allowed males to compete in girls\u2019 sports, opened our border, and has crushed our oil production.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) For this fact-check, we focused on the claim about sports. PolitiFact has checked claims related to the other issues and found them all to be false or mostly false. That includes this claim that Democrats forced the National Guard to sleep in a parking garage; a claim that Biden questioned the National Guard\u2019s loyalty; a claim that Biden sparked a migrant caravan from Honduras because of his immigration policies; and a claim that Biden has banned fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from the ground. The claim that Biden \"allowed males to compete in girls sports\" likely stems from an executive order from the Biden administration titled \"Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.\" Shortly after the order was issued, Twitter users began discussing its potential effect on women in sports, and the hashtag #BidenErasedWomen was trending, Newsweek reported. But the idea that the order will allow transgender females \u2014 whose sex at birth was male but whose gender identity is female \u2014 to compete in women\u2019s sports is misguided. The Biden executive order does not impose any new guidelines that would immediately bring changes to school sports, and it only mentions sports once: \"Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports.\" Instead, it requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Education Department, to review existing policies and programs to determine whether they are in line with the new guidance prohibiting discrimination based on gender and sexuality, and to implement changes if needed. The Jan. 20 executive order extends protections from a 2020 Supreme Court case that addressed employment law to other federal laws, including those that cover education and school-related activities. In that case, Bostock v. Clayton County, the court ruled that employers cannot fire a person for being gay or transgender because it violates Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. \"Because Title VII is limited to employment discrimination, it was unclear how the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would be applied to other federal discrimination statutes that prohibit sex discrimination in other contexts,\" according to the National Law Review. \"The Biden administration has now stated its view that Bostock applies with equal force.\" That\u2019s a departure from the Trump administration, which had narrowly interpreted the Bostock case and determined it did not apply to education-related discrimination policies. It\u2019s possible that the executive order could result in changes that affect transgender participation in sports, the National Law Review reports: \"The current administration will likely implement major changes related to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or transgender status. This may include requiring schools to allow students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that are consistent with their gender identity, and to play on athletic teams that are consistent with their gender identity. \" The publication also notes, though, that the executive order \"is a high level policy statement and does not, in and of itself, immediately change any practices for public school districts.\" A Facebook post says Biden has \"allowed males to compete in girls\u2019 sports.\" The claim seems to be based on an executive order Biden issued that prohibits discrimination based on gender and sexuality in education, but that opponents say will allow transgender females to compete in women\u2019s sports. The executive order does not propose changes to policies or include details about specific programs such as sports. It mandates that federal agencies review programs and policies to be sure they do not discriminate, and to make changes if needed. We rate this claim False.",

        "claim": "Says Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.",
        "doc": "Implying that Nancy Pelosi used insider information for personal gain, a post widely shared on Facebook claims that the House speaker bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before President Joe Biden signed an executive order for all federal vehicles to be electric. We looked at the substance and implications of the broadside against the California Democrat and found that it paints a misleading picture of the timing and nature of Pelosi\u2019s and Biden\u2019s actions. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post gets several facts wrong. In short: The purchase \u2014 by Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul Pelosi \u2014 was not of stock in Tesla, the California-based maker of electric cars, but of options to buy Tesla stock. The options were bought more than a month before Biden announced his goal to eventually make the federal fleet electric, not the day before. Biden has not ordered that the entire federal fleet be electric. Hehas directed federal agencies to move toward buying zero-emission vehicles. And Biden\u2019s intent to steer the government toward zero-emission vehicles was not inside information. It was among his campaign promises and a matter of public record well before he took office. The post shows photos of Pelosi and Biden, along with captions that use abbreviations for executive order and electric vehicles. The caption to the Pelosi photo is: \"1/24/21 Nancy buys $1.25M in Tesla stock.\" The Biden photo caption says: \"1/25/21 Joe signs EO for all fed vehicles to be EV!\" The headline above the images reads: \"Wow! What are the odds of that? Talk about luck!! What are the odds?\" The poster wrote: \"Wake up, realizing that it\u2019s all about them making money, well (sic) restricting us.\" The post misstates the timing of both the securities transaction and the executive order. Under the Ethics in Government Act, members of Congress must file periodic transaction reports when they buy or sell stock or other securities for any transaction that exceeds $1,000. (The requirement also covers transactions by a lawmaker\u2019s spouse and dependent children.) Only a range of the value of a transaction must be disclosed. The reports must be filed within 30 days of when the member was notified of the transaction, and no later than 45 days after the transaction occurred. Nancy Pelosi filed a report with the House dated Jan. 21 listing her husband\u2019s securities transactions involving Tesla and a few other companies. \"The Speaker has no involvement or prior knowledge of these transactions,\" said her spokesman, Drew Hammill. According to the report, on Dec. 22, Paul Pelosi bought 25 call options of Tesla stock for between $500,001 and $1 million. The options had a strike price of $500 and an expiration date of March 18, 2022. In other words, Paul Pelosi purchased the right to buy Tesla stock at $500 per share prior to the expiration date. On Dec. 22, Tesla stock was trading at around $650, having climbed from less than $90 at the start of 2020, on a split-adjusted basis. At the time of this writing on Feb. 2, Tesla\u2019s stock was trading at about $878 a share Nancy Pelosi\u2019s report appears to be in line with what members of Congress are required to disclose. During his run for president, Biden pledged to \"make a major federal commitment to purchase clean vehicles for federal, state, tribal, postal, and local fleets.\" So his intent to steer the government toward an electric fleet was a matter of public record, though it didn\u2019t take the form of an executive order until Jan. 27, a week after he took office. The post we\u2019re checking alludes to an executive order Biden signed Jan. 25. That \"Buy American\" order does not mention any federal government purchases of electric vehicles. But in signing the order, Biden announced that he plans to eventually replace the government\u2019s fleet of cars and trucks with electric vehicles assembled in the United States. He did not state a timeline, or mention any specific manufacturer. The Jan. 27 order, on climate, included a \"federal clean electricity and vehicle procurement strategy.\" It directed \"all available procurement authorities to achieve or facilitate \u2026 clean and zero-emission vehicles for Federal, State, local, and Tribal government fleets, including vehicles of the United States Postal Service.\" The order specifically calls for \"spurring the creation of union jobs\" in the manufacture of those new vehicles. Tesla\u2019s assembly workers in California are not unionized. No manufacturer of electric vehicles in the United States complies with the new \"Buy American\" and unionized labor provisions, according to Wired. Replacing the federal fleet with American-produced EVs will be costly and take time, as only a handful of all-electric vehicle models are assembled in the United States, CNBC reported. An image shared on Facebook claims that Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Biden signed an order \"for all federal vehicles\" to be electric, implying that she sought to profit from insideinformation about new government policies. The House speaker did report transactions involving Tesla stock, but the post misrepresented the purchases and Biden\u2019s policies to create the false impression that the transactions represented improper insider trading in Tesla shares. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts would give a different impression \u2014 our definition of Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\u201cMyanmar used Dominion Voting Systems.\u201d",
        "doc": "In November, after Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s ruling party in Myanmar claimed an overwhelming victory in the country\u2019s parliamentary election, the military-backed opposition alleged election fraud. Myanmar\u2019s election commission rejected those claims, but on Feb. 1, the military seized control of the country and detained Suu Kyi among other members of her party. On social media, some proponents of conspiracy theories saw the coup as a sign that something similar could happen in the United States, where supporters of former President Donald Trump have made baseless allegations about voter fraud and sought to overturn his election loss. Many of those claims involved Dominion Voting Systems, which makes election software and hardware. Now, another unfounded claim about the company is circulating online. \"The White House is freaking out after Myanmar military arrests political leaders for election fraud in their November 8 elections,\" one Facebook post said. \"Myanmar used Dominion Voting Systems.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Searching online, including reviewing news stories about the election and military ouster, we found no evidence to support that claim. In a statement, a spokesperson for Dominion told PolitiFact: \"This is a completely false claim. Dominion systems have never been used in Myanmar at any time.\" That\u2019s corroborated by a report on the 2020 election in Myanmar, which doesn\u2019t mention Dominion or any electronic voting system. Voters used paper ballots, folding them to ensure secrecy before dropping them in the ballot box. We rate this post False.",

        "claim": "North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"",
        "doc": "Former North Carolina agriculture commissioner candidate Jenna Wadsworth says Secretary of State Elaine Marshall has an unparalleled political record. \"Sec. Marshall has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive in NC at this point or is damn close,\" Wadsworth tweeted. Wadsworth tweeted the claim as part of a message urging Democrats to consider the strength of female candidates before moving ahead with another white male nominee for U.S. Senate. The current seat holder, Republican Richard Burr, says he won\u2019t seek reelection in 2022. The same day as her tweet, state Sen. Jeff Jackson announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate. We wondered: Is it true that Secretary of State Elaine Marshall has won more statewide races in North Carolina than anyone alive? Wadsworth said she was thinking of not only general elections but also primaries when she tweeted her claim about Marshall. However, we\u2019ll focus on general elections for a couple reasons. For one, in North Carolina, primaries aren\u2019t open to every voter. We also found it difficult to find official primary records dating back several decades. So we scrolled through internet archives, reached out to the state\u2019s political parties and consulted UNC School of Government Librarian Alex Hess. It appears Wadsworth is right. The \"statewide\" part means we\u2019re only looking at U.S. senators, governors, Council of State members, and judges. And the \"alive\" part is key. If you consider all candidates living or dead, Marshall does not hold the record for winning the most statewide elections in North Carolina. That record likely belongs to the late Thad Eure, who was elected secretary of state 13 times and served for 53 years. The late former agriculture commissioner Jim Graham, who won nine times, appears to have won the second-most statewide races. Marshall, 75, has been elected secretary of state seven times dating back to 1996. She ran for U.S. Senate twice, losing the Democratic primary in 2002, and then winning a primary runoff in 2010 but losing to Burr in the general election. When it comes to statewide races won, Marshall\u2019s closest competitor appears to be Gov. Roy Cooper. Cooper has won six statewide races dating back to 2000. Before winning gubernatorial races in 2020 and 2016, voters elected Cooper attorney general four times. If we consider primaries, Marshall appears to be tied for winning the most races for statewide office. When we include the three primaries Marshall has won, her tally comes to 10 victories for statewide election. When Cooper\u2019s four primaries are counted, he also lands at 10 statewide wins. Former Gov. Jim Hunt has also won 10, if you count each of the primaries he won prior to winning four terms as governor and one as lieutenant governor. Before Hunt\u2019s tenure, governors could only serve one term and were not allowed to run for reelection. Incumbency has served top North Carolinians well through the years. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of notable current and former politicians who have won multiple statewide races. U.S. Senators: The late Jesse Helms was elected to Senate five times and served for 40 years. Burr won three terms and Thom Tillis has won two terms in the U.S. Senate. Prior to running for Senate, neither ran a statewide race. Other recent senators -- Kay Hagan, Elizabeth Dole, John Edwards, Lauch Faircloth -- each one a single term. Governors: Of North Carolina\u2019s other living former governors, Mike Easley won the most statewide races. He won two terms for governor and two for attorney general. Former Gov. Jim Martin won two terms, while Pat McCrory and Bev Perdue each served a single term. Perdue, for her part, also won two terms as lieutenant governor. Council of State: Several commissioners and Council of State members have won five or more statewide races. The late Jim Long won six terms as insurance commissioner. Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler has won five terms in a row dating back to 2004. Cherie Berry won five terms as labor commissioner before retiring in 2020. Rufus Edmisten won three races for attorney general and two for secretary of state. Judges: North Carolina judges are unlikely to ever reach Eure\u2019s record \u2014 or even Marshall\u2019s mark \u2014 because they serve eight-year terms and are legally blocked from working full-time beyond age 72. Linda McGee last month retired as the longest serving Court of Appeals judge in state history, winning three races after being appointed in 1995. Wadsworth said Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive in NC at this point.\" It appears she\u2019s right. We rate this claim True.",

        "claim": "\"The Legislature spent the last decade passing laws deliberately making it even harder for people to access these critical supports when they need it most, exacerbating the problems with our already-outdated system.\u201d",
        "doc": "Wisconsin has faced a host of issues with unemployment payments during the coronavirus pandemic. First, the outdated system for managing claims was overwhelmed, creating a backlog that persisted for most of 2020. The Department of Workforce Development also saw an influx of calls about unclear questions, mistakes on applications and general confusion about unemployment benefits, of which only a small percentage were answered. Some people have waited nearly a year for their benefits to arrive, living on the edge of losing homes, cars and the ability to feed families. Gov. Tony Evers has faced backlash over how his administration has handled the issue. He, in turn, has said the GOP-controlled Legislature carries much of the blame. Here is how Evers phrased it Jan. 12, 2021 during his annual State of the State address: \"The fact of the matter is that previous administrations and more than a decades\u2019 worth of legislators have known this system was outdated and couldn\u2019t handle an economic crisis like the one this pandemic presented, and they never took the time to fix it. And to make matters worse, the Legislature spent the last decade passing laws deliberately making it even harder for people to access these critical supports when they need it most, exacerbating the problems with our already-outdated system.\" That\u2019s a lot. For this fact check, we are focusing on the end of the claim. Did actions by the Legislature -- which the GOP has held outright since 2010 -- deliberately make it harder to get benefits and exacerbate problems? When asked for backup, Britt Cudabeck, deputy communications director for Evers, cited a series of laws passed since 2011 related to unemployment. Many were outlined in a May 26, 2020 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Here\u2019s a look at some of the laws: In 2011, the Legislature passed a law creating a one-week waiting period before anyone who lost a job could claim benefits. Then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, signed the measure. Evers and Republican lawmakers agreed to suspend the waiting period, but the law is expected to go back into effect in the coming months. In 2012, Republicans approved a law that prevented claimants from receiving benefits if they didn\u2019t search for work, worked more than 32 hours in a week or got more than $500 in sick pay, holiday pay, vacation pay or termination pay. In 2013, among other changes, Republicans expanded the work search requirement and established more instances in which benefits could be cut off for \"misconduct,\" which previously had to be decided on a case-by-case basis. In 2015, they passed a law requiring people seeking unemployment benefits to take a drug test, but that measure has not yet been implemented because the federal government did not sign off on the measure until 2019. During the same year, Republicans increased the number of situations in which someone can be denied benefits for refusing a job offer. Most recently, in 2018, just before Evers took office, Republican lawmakers approved lame-duck laws that limited the governor\u2019s power in many ways, including by restricting the ability of the administration to waive many criteria for receiving benefits. A 2017 study by the National Employment Law Projectfound that Wisconsin had one of the steepest increases in unemployment denials between 2012 and 2016, the time in which most of the above measures were passed. The denial rate for those five years was 10%, up from 1% from 2007 to 2011. So, there is no question Republicans passed a series of changes that made receiving unemployment benefits more difficult. That said, there are other elements to the claim. Part of Evers\u2019 claim was the GOP-backed changes were \"exacerbating the problems with our already-outdated system.\" Adam Gibbs, communications director for Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said the intent of the bills was to help close a deficit. Meanwhile, Adam King, director of social media for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said in an email that the changes in state law were \"consistent with many other states and federal guidance\" and that the changes have not been the cause of slower benefit payments. Neither directly addressed whether the changes in the law made the problems being experienced today worse. The Evers administration has said the outdated unemployment computer system, which is nearly 50 years old, is hard to program, causes delays and makes applying for unemployment hard for Wisconsinites. Yet, after the backlog developed, amid a public outcry, Evers replaced the head of the department and under new leadership (and a partnership with Google Cloud), the backlog of claims has nearly disappeared. So, the backlog was cleared using the same system, which undermines Evers\u2019 point. Evers claimed the Legislature has made it harder for people to access unemployment insurance over the last decade. The changes made to the unemployment system by Republicans over the past decade is well documented. And the changes have been grafted into an outdated computer system. But those changes are not entirely to blame for the problems getting the system functioning smoothly today. We rate this claim Half True. ",

        "doc": "In what looks like an online advertisement for the clothes retailer H&M, a boy is smiling with his hands stuffed in the pocket of a white hooded sweatshirt. The shirt reads: \"Koolest Kid in the Klan.\" Most of the text is white and black while each of the three Ks is red so that \"KKK\" pops out. The sweatshirt appears to sell for $24.99. But the ad, which is being shared on Facebook, isn\u2019t authentic. This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence that H&M ever sold such an item, and if it did, it would be widely covered in the press \u2014especially since the company came under intense scrutiny in 2018 for using a Black child to model a sweatshirt that said \"Coolest Monkey in the Jungle.\" That year, H&M had to temporarily close several stores in South Africa after people protested the sweatshirt as racist. The image in this Facebook post appears to be in response to the monkey sweatshirt. It started appearing on Reddit and meme websites in 2018. Doing a reverse image search of the boy in the KKK sweatshirt, we found what looks like the original image. In this version, though, the front of the sweatshirt is blank. H&M didn\u2019t respond to PolitiFact\u2019s query about the Facebook post, but Lead Stories reported that a spokesperson told the fact-checking website that the photo is fake.

        "claim": "Gov. Tony Evers \u201chas the authority and revenue necessary\u201d to upgrade the Wisconsin unemployment system without the Legislature.",
        "doc": "Wisconsin\u2019s beleaguered unemployment system is the latest battleground in the ongoing showdown between Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the Republican-run Legislature. The system continues to stagger beneath the weight of pandemic-driven job losses, with thousands of Wisconsinites forced to wait months for benefits to be processed. Evers and his administration have drawn widespread criticism for the system, which also spurred the governor to effectively fire the head of the state\u2019s workforce development agency. Evers has also leveled blame at Republicans, noting no action was taken to upgrade a system long known to be insufficient during the eight-year stretch where the GOP controlled both the Legislature and governor\u2019s mansion. The governor tried to push the issue forward with a special session on unemployment Jan. 19, but the Legislature convened and adjourned the session within seconds \u2014 as they have many other sessions Evers has called in an attempt to initiate action in one of the least active Legislatures in the country. Republicans have said such a step isn\u2019t needed. \"It took us all of five minutes to understand that (Evers) has the authority and the revenue necessary to complete this task now,\" Assembly Majority Leaders Jim Steineke said in a Jan. 17, 2021, appearance on WKOW TV\u2019s Capitol City Sunday program. \"He doesn\u2019t need legislative approval. So if he\u2019s just looking for us to put a stamp of approval on, hey governor, you got it, go ahead. The Legislature agrees with you, move forward. You don\u2019t have to wait for us to pass it.\" Steineke later said Evers \"has all the flexibility to find the money necessary to complete what he wants to complete on this.\" Are Steineke and Republicans right that Evers has both the authority and revenue to address the unemployment system on his own? Let\u2019s take a closer look. The task being debated here isn\u2019t a small one. Evers\u2019 office has estimated an overhaul of the state\u2019s unemployment system would take 10 years to complete and cost $90 million. A Jan. 13, 2021, memo from the state\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the cost at between $48 million and $70 million. This comes as the unemployment system continues to see claims far above historical norms, fueling continued delays in processing payments. This will be the second attempt at such an upgrade, after an effort under Gov. Jim Doyle failed at great taxpayer expense. That unemployment system update was abandoned in 2007 after racking up a tab of $24 million. The Doyle project was funded by technology fees and one-time federal funds, but neither of those is available now. So Evers has said he plans to fund this upgrade through the state\u2019s master lease program. The program, which dates back to 1991, is a way for agencies to finance the cost of IT projects over a number of years when projects are too large to allow lump-sum payment. From 2014 to 2020, $142 million was approved through this program for 28 different IT projects across state government, according to a September 2020 report on the master lease program from the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau. State agencies can apply for this funding through the state Department of Administration, which decides whether to approve the applications and then obtains the necessary loans. The Legislature is not involved in the approval process, but it is involved in setting aside money that is used to make those lease payments. More on that in a bit. Steineke spokeswoman Alesha Emmert said Evers has the authority to begin the upgrade process by issuing a request for proposal, as his administration has done with many other upgrades without legislative approval. Britt Cudaback, a spokeswoman for Evers, acknowledged the governor has the authority to start the process, but she argued it\u2019s irrelevant without ongoing funding. \"Funding a (request for proposal) \u2026 is meaningless if there\u2019s no commitment from the Legislature to fund the rest of the project,\" Cudaback said in an email. \"Given the substantial cost for the overall project of $90 million, (Evers\u2019) goal is to ensure funds will be there for the master lease payments in future biennia.\" Addressing the revenue question, the only specific funding source Emmert identified is a procurement appropriations fund overseen by the Department of Administration that had a $4 million balance at the end of the 2020 fiscal year. But that is far from sufficient in the context of a project that could cost $90 million. And even that fund isn\u2019t accessible, as Emmert asserts. The funds are allocated to the Department of Administration to fund its role procuring items for agencies, not for transferring to other agencies to directly fund purchases, Cudaback said. In addition, the balance is projected to be only $2 million by the end of the 2021 fiscal year. Most notably, that fund was not listed among the potential funding sources in a list compiled by the fiscal bureau. State Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, asked the agency to identify potential ways to pay for the unemployment upgrades. The resulting memo identified nine funding sources that could be allowable under statute. Seven of those had a balance of $25,000 or less, one had a liability of $85 million and one had a balance around $15 million. That fund, per statute, is to be used for the \"payment of costs associated with program integrity activities,\" and is currently used for fraud investigation, worker classification enforcement, identify verification and criminal prosecutions, among other things. Even if the entirety of that investigation fund were co-opted from its current use, it would fund just a fraction of expected cost. Whatever the mechanism, it\u2019s clear funds will need to be set aside across multiple years. And the way to approve such ongoing funding is through the budget \u2014 which must pass the Legislature. The fiscal bureau memo pointed out the need for legislative involvement in the project. In response to a question about whether the Joint Finance Committee could move appropriations from another agency to fund the first payments toward the upgrade (it can), the memo noted this: \"If the Committee (did the transfer), it would be incumbent on the Legislature during the budget process to approve monies in subsequent biennia sufficient to fulfill the annual master lease costs over its term.\" That Legislative role was echoed in the 2020 audit. It suggested the Legislature consider getting involved in the master lease approval process since it is responsible for appropriating the needed money. \"Master lease payments must be made from funds that have been appropriated to state agencies,\" the audit said. \"Therefore, the Legislature could consider modifying statutes to require (the Department of Administration) to obtain its approval before approving applications for master lease funding above a specified amount or for specified projects, such as large, high-risk IT projects.\" Steineke\u2019s claim about Evers\u2019 power is particularly unusual since it contradicts his party\u2019s usual view on financial oversight. Republicans argued explicitly against the idea of Evers allocating funding unilaterally in recent days. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos addressed the matter while defending a COVID-19 bill that would give the Republican-controlled finance committee oversight of how federal aid is spent in Wisconsin. \"It\u2019s not something that\u2019s all that abnormal,\" Vos, R-Rochester, said on PBS Wisconsin\u2019s Here & Now program Jan. 29, 2021. \"It should mean the Legislature, the ones that are supposed to appropriate money, have the ability to oversee it just like we do with every other dollar that comes into the state treasury.\" Steineke said Evers \"has the authority and revenue necessary\" to upgrade the state unemployment system without the Legislature. Evers has the authority and funding to begin the process by seeking out proposals, yes. But it\u2019s an empty authority when there are no sources under Evers\u2019 control that come close to funding the full project. Steineke\u2019s claim related to revenue simply isn\u2019t true. Both sides acknowledge a master lease would be a logical way forward, and that requires ongoing funding over the course of multiple state budgets \u2014 which has to be approved by the Legislature. We define Mostly False as a statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.",

        "claim": "\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"",
        "doc": "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., arguing against President Joe Biden\u2019s immigration agenda, claimed that there\u2019s no screening process for people coming into the United States. While millions of Americans are out of work, Cotton said in a Feb. 1 Fox News interview, Biden wants to give \"amnesty to 15 million\" people living illegally in the country, invite more guest workers, and give people \"with bogus claims of asylum\" an opportunity to come into the country to work. \"And we are in a pandemic, good job,\" Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade responded sarcastically. Cotton continued: \"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\" He praised former President Donald Trump\u2019s \"Remain in Mexico\" policy to keep asylum seekers in Mexico, \"as opposed to being released into our country\" pending a hearing. During his presidential campaign, Biden promised a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people illegally in the country, and spoke out against the Remain in Mexico program, saying he would allow people seeking asylum to stay in the U.S. while their cases were under review. Biden\u2019s administration stopped enrolling people in the program, but has not revoked it. We asked Cotton\u2019s press office for more information about his claim that there\u2019s \"no way to screen\" migrants. \"Relying on the honor system for security and health background checks is not a sufficient screen,\" said Caroline Tabler, a spokesperson for Cotton. But U.S. officials don\u2019t have to rely on an \"honor system.\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection has tools and processes to screen immigrants who are apprehended at the border for health and security issues, even if the people aren\u2019t fully upfront or don\u2019t have medical records or documentation on hand proving they have a clean background. CBP told PolitiFact that it does initial inspections for symptoms or risk factors associated with COVID-19, and \"pursuant to longstanding infectious disease protocols,\" refers immigrants who might have an infectious disease to local clinics or hospitals \"for appropriate medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment.\" Procedures for COVID-19 have been in place since the beginning of the pandemic, said Matthew Dyman, a spokesperson for the CBP. In late April, CBP said that a 31-year-old Indian man was the first person in its custody to test positive for COVID-19. The oversight office within the Department of Homeland Security surveyed CBP personnel from April 22 to May 1. Ninety percent of the Border Patrol stations and ports of entry offices that responded to the survey said they conducted risk assessments to determine if people in CBP custody were exposed to COVID-19. Protocols included \"screening individuals for COVID-19 symptoms when they are initially processed at a facility, and continued monitoring for potential COVID-19 symptoms for as long as they remain in CBP custody,\" said the September 2020 inspector general report. The report said, however, that it was rare for facilities to be able to administer COVID-19 tests on site. As of July 13, 58 migrants across all Border Patrol stations had tested positive for COVID-19, the report said. CBP in late 2019 issued a directive to improve the medical screening of people in its custody after several children died while in CBP care. The three-phase approach called forCBP personnel to observe people for potential medical issues, conduct health interviews on all people under 18 years old, \"at a minimim\"; and \"subject to availability of resources and operational requirements,\" perform a medical assessment on children age 12 and younger and people with a known or reported medical concern. Implementation of the directive was contingent upon funding and resources, the CBP acting commissioner said in 2019. Whether CBP\u2019s health screening procedures are sufficient and effective can be debated, but it\u2019s inaccurate to say there\u2019s \"no way to screen\" people. The Texas Tribune and ProPublica reported in August that a different immigration agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was testing unaccompanied children for COVID-19 and deporting those who tested negative. The news organizations said that ICE had agreements with 10 countries requiring that children test negative for COVID-19 before being sent back to their home countries. The Washington Post reported in early December that 1,061 minors in U.S. immigration custody had tested positive for COVID-19 since March. In March 2020, the Trump administration invoked Title 42, a section of federal law that allows the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to deny entry to immigrants coming from countries with infectious disease outbreaks. So far, Biden\u2019s administration has kept that directive, allowing quick expulsion of people arriving at the border. CBP has access to international databases through TECS, an information-sharing platform that allows the agency to obtain the criminal history of a person who attempts to enter the United States, said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. A 2016 DHS report said that the purpose of TECS was \"to track individuals who have violated or are suspected of violating a law or regulation that is enforced or administered by CBP, to provide a record of any inspections conducted at the border by CBP, to determine admissibility into the United States, and to record information regarding individuals, firms, and organizations to whom DHS/CBP has issued detentions and warnings.\" CBP statistics on the number of \"criminal aliens\" identified at the border prove that CBP regularly identifies individuals with criminal histories before they enter the United States, Hallett said. If a person poses a threat to national security, they can\u2019t get asylum, said Lynn Marcus, director of the Community Immigration Law Placement Clinic at the University of Arizona. \"There is a process for screening all of this,\" she said. Cotton said, \"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or security.\" A CBP database allows personnel to run criminal background checks on people apprehended at the border and access records collected by U.S. and foreign authorities. CBP routinely publishes data on immigrants who attempted to enter the country and have a criminal record. CBP might not always have access to a person\u2019s full medical records, but the agency says it screens people for COVID-19 and other health issues. It\u2019s fair to question whether existing protocols are sufficient, but it\u2019s inaccurate to say \"we have no way to screen\" immigrants. We rate Cotton\u2019s claim False.",

In a Jan. 27 interview with Yahoo Entertainment, he was asked about his role at a time when protests against police have roiled the country in recent months. \"You\u2019ve played good cops, you\u2019ve played bad cops, your cop here is a good man with a checkered past,\" Yahoo correspondent Kevin Polowy said. \"It feels like a really interesting time to play law enforcement given recent events and conversations we\u2019re having about policing right now. This film really does cut into sort of the complications of the profession. How much thought do you put into a role like this when it comes to how law enforcement is represented?\" Washington responded by describing a ridealong he did with an officer when he was preparing for his role in another movie. Washington said he stayed in the car while the officer got out and encountered a distraught man with a gun, eventually diffusing the situation. \"In an instant it taught me, and I never forgot it, what our law enforcement people have to deal with moment to moment, second to second, and I have the utmost respect for what they do, for what our soldiers do, that sacrifice their lives,\" Washington said. \"I just don\u2019t care for people that put those kinds of people down.

A representative for Washington told Reuters that the quote is false. Washington did not mention Black Lives Matter during the interview, but he was asked about the movement during another interview in December 2016, at a premiere for his movie \"Fences.\" The interviewer that year wondered whether Washington thought the Black Lives Matter movement had helped race relations in the United States. Washington skirted the question and said, \"Listen. We live in America, and in America we have the freedom to express ourselves. We shouldn\u2019t take that for granted. So whatever the movements are, whether you agree with them or don\u2019t, they have the right to express themselves. So that\u2019s one of the great things about being in this country, that you do have the right to protest.\" We rate this headline Mostly False.",

Both the Secret Service and the Palm Beach Police Department told PolitiFact that this blog post is bunk. \"The narrative presented here is completely false,\" a spokesperson for the Secret Service said. And the police department, which was supposedly alerted by this bullet, received \"no such information,\" said spokesperson Michael Ogrodnick. We found no news coverage to support the account in this blog post. Previous episodes involving weapons and gunfire at Mar-a-Lago during Trump\u2019s presidency were widely covered in the news. In August 2020, for example, three teens were arrested after inadvertently entering the resort with a loaded assault rifle, according to BBC News. In January 2020, officers fired at a vehicle that crashed through two security checkpoints at Mar-a-Lago. But there\u2019s nothing that supports claims of a Deep State plot to assassinate the former president in January 2021. We rate this blog post False.

        "claim": "Joe Biden \"really did wipe away\" student loan debt.",
        "doc": "Facebook has some good news for anyone with student loans: President Joe Biden has already canceled them. Or did he? In a Feb. 2 post, one user wrote that her student loan debt had mysteriously vanished. \"Wow, just checked my Credit Karma and Biden really did wipe away my student loans $20k worth of debt,\" the user wrote. \"God is good!\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A few other Facebook users shared in the celebration, so we wanted to check this post out. (Screenshot from Facebook) During his presidential campaign, Biden promised to make federal student loan payments more affordable for Americans \u2014particularly people with low incomes and public servants. But those plans have not yet come to fruition, and Biden hasn\u2019t said he\u2019d cancel student loans for everyone. Here\u2019s what Biden promised: \"Forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities and private HBCUs (historically Black colleges and universities) and MSIs (minority-serving institutions) for debt-holders earning up to $125,000.\" \"Include in the COVID-19 response an immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of federal student loan debt.\" Forgive \"$10,000 of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year of national or community service, up to five years.\" \"More than halve payments on undergraduate federal student loans by simplifying and increasing the generosity of today\u2019s income-based repayment program.\" Biden has extended a pause on federal student loan payments, but none of the executive orders he has signed so far follow through on his campaign promises. In December, he said it\u2019s \"pretty questionable\" whether he\u2019d have the power to forgive up to $50,000 of debt via executive order. Congress has not passed legislation canceling student loan debt, either. On Jan. 20, the day of Biden\u2019s inauguration, the president introduced a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. Among its provisions are $1,400 stimulus checks for most Americans, an unemployment insurance supplement of $400 per week and an increase in the federal minimum wage. Student loan debt forgiveness is not mentioned in the plan. Neither loan forgiveness nor a payment pause were included in the December relief package. We can\u2019t speak to what may have happened to the Facebook user\u2019s student loan debt, but the post that credits Biden for wiping it away is inaccurate. We rate it False.",

        "doc": "Donald Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in a violent insurrection against the federal government. But some Facebook users accused Democrats of a similar uprising in 2018. On Feb. 4, Ted Nugent, a singer-songwriter and conservative activist, shared a photo of people crowded into a rotunda. \"Remember when Democrat protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol in 2018, took over the U.S. Senate building, and tried to get into the U.S. Supreme Court during the (Brett) Kavanaugh confirmations?\" says text in the image. \"Democrat legislators and the MSM cheered it on. If it wasn\u2019t for double standards liberals would have no standards at all.\" (Screenshot from Facebook) This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The meme has been shared in dozens of other public Facebook posts, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. There were demonstrations at the U.S. Capitol and nearby buildings during the Kavanaugh hearings, which drew protests after the nominee was accused of sexual assault. But the photo Nugent posted doesn\u2019t show that. It shows protesters in the Wisconsin state capitol building nearly a decade ago. In mid-February 2011, tens of thousands of demonstrators protested in Madison, Wis., against Republican legislation aimed at removing the collective bargaining rights of an estimated 300,000 workers. Many crowded into the capitol building itself and, by Feb. 20, 2011, some demonstrators had begun a physical occupation of the building. The photo in Nugent\u2019s Facebook post is similar to one taken Feb. 18, 2011, by Mary Bottari of the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal nonprofit organization. It shows protesters crowded onto three floors in the Wisconsin Capitol rotunda. Unlike the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the 2011 protests were largely peaceful. Watch more footage of the demonstrations below: In 2018, hundreds of people protesting Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation were arrested after gathering in Senate buildings and galleries, including the Russell Senate Office Building rotunda. Others were charged with \"crowding, obstructing, or incommoding\" the East Front steps of the Capitol building. But a photo Nugent relies on to show that Democrats \"stormed\" the U.S. Capitol doesn\u2019t show any of that. We rate it False.",

        "doc": "House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has been dealing with a fight in Congress over how to handle freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has made comments supporting violence against Democrats and promotedthe baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. The FBI has called the QAnon movement a domestic terrorism threat, and its adherents were among those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, driving McCarthy and other lawmakers out of their chambers as they counted electoral votes. But in a press briefing Feb. 3, McCarthy professed ignorance about QAnon, and mispronounced its name. Defending Greene, he said: \"I think it would be helpful if you could hear exactly what she told all of us \u2014 denouncing \u2018Q-on.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if I say it right. I don\u2019t even know what it is.\" pic.twitter.com/J2XfuRYVG7 QAnon\u2019s involvement in the Capitol riot drove a surge in awareness of the movement, whose followers believe former President Donald Trump was on a secret mission to fight a cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles that includes top-ranking Democrats and Hollywood celebrities. So can McCarthy fairly claim, less than a month after the riot, that he doesn\u2019t know what QAnon is \u2014 or even how to say its name? No, he can\u2019t. McCarthy has spoken about QAnon publicly at least three times, and appeared to know enough about it to speak out against it. He\u2019s also pronounced the name correctly before. In an Aug. 21 press briefing, McCarthy got a question about Greene, who had just won her primary in Georgia. In his answer, he explicitly denounced QAnon, which he called \"the Q organization.\" \"She recently came out and denounced the Q organization, whatever beliefs, I do not agree with their beliefs at all,\" he said. At the time, Greene hadn\u2019t denounced QAnon, although she had told Fox News that she had since chosen \"another path.\" In an interview with Fox News that same day, McCarthy denounced QAnon a second time and pronounced it correctly. \"Let me be very clear: There is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party. I do not support it,\" he said. During a November news conference, a reporter asked McCarthy if he was concerned about new members of Congress like Greene and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., who have expressed support for QAnon. \"Our party is very diverse. You mentioned two people who are going to join our party, and both of them have denounced Q-on,\" he replied, mispronouncing it again. This was also misleading. While Boebert had attempted to distance herself from the conspiracy theory, Greene still had not. A McCarthy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. McCarthy said, \"I don\u2019t even know what (QAnon) is.\" McCarthy has spoken about QAnon in at least three public appearances. He has also explicitly denounced the extremist ideology before. We rate his claim False.",

        "claim": "\"BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law\"",
        "doc": "On Feb. 4, U.S. coronavirus deaths exceeded 450,000. According to some social media users, the official death toll can\u2019t be trusted. One blog post shared thousands of times on social media claims official COVID-19 data is being inflated. \"BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law,\" reads the headline on a National File post. The claim was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post that follows the National File\u2019s headline claims that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has inflated COVID-19 fatality data. \"CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge,\" the blog post reads. This is not the first time coronavirus death statistics have been the focus of online misinformation. PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations have debunked prior claims that the CDC decreased the number of coronavirus deaths from 153,504 to 9,210. And despite what the blog post claims, there is still no evidence to suggest the CDC is inflating coronavirus mortality data. The study that the blog post points to as its primary evidence was produced by a private group called the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked a false claim by the institute\u2019s leader James Lyons-Weiler. A study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information also debunked Lyons-Weiler\u2019s claim that the virus behind the ongoing pandemic was created in a lab. In this case, the study does not definitively say that the CDC inflated COVID-19 deaths. Rather, it calls into question guidelines the CDC issued in March 2020 that were designed to more accurately capture mortality data related to the coronavirus. The study\u2019s authors called the guidance \"a capricious alteration to data collection has compromised the accuracy, quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of their published data.\" The study\u2019s conclusions are carefully worded (with boldface added by PolitiFact for emphasis): \"It is concerning that the CDC may have willfully failed to collect, analyze, and publish accurate data used by elected officials to develop public health policy for a nation in crisis [...] If the data being reported was indeed compromised by the CDC\u2019s perplexing decision to abandon proven data collection and reporting practices in favor of untested methods, then all public health policies based upon these inaccurate data must be reexamined.\" Ultimately, the study\u2019s ten authors \u2014at least one of whom is not a medical expert \u2014 conclude that \"further federal investigation is justified.\" They do not prove or conclude that the CDC inflated COVID-19 death data or violated federal laws. Additionally, experts who study the data say that it is far more likely that official counts of coronavirus deaths are too low. In April 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, weighed in on the allegation that the coronavirus death toll was being inflated because people were actually dying of other conditions. \"There is absolutely no evidence that that\u2019s the case at all,\" Fauci said in an NBC News interview. \"I think it falls under the category of something that\u2019s very unfortunate \u2014 these conspiracy theories that we hear about.\" Fauci went on to say he thought it was possible COVID-19 deaths were being undercounted. \"I think there\u2019s more of a chance of missing some [deaths] that are really coronavirus deaths,\" he said. \"But I don\u2019t think that number is significant enough to really substantially modify the trends that we\u2019re seeing at all.\" Roderick Little, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Michigan, told PolitiFact that \"a more reliable picture\" of the coronavirus death toll could be seen by \"looking at excess death rates over historical patterns, as on the same date in previous years.\" \"If anything, I'd expect the CDC numbers to be underestimates, not overestimates,\" Little said. \"I note that the lack of testing for COVID early in the pandemic would contribute to such an underestimate.\" A blog post headline reads, \"BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law.\" There is no evidence to suggest that the CDC has inflated the number of U.S. coronavirus deaths. In fact, experts agree it is more likely that coronavirus deaths are being undercounted. We rate this claim False.",

        "claim": "Says Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., \u201cstood with Trump and the lies\u2026 He stood with QAnon, not you.\u201d",
        "doc": "House Democrats are trying to hang the QAnon label around the necks of as many Republicans as possible. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene gave Democrats their moment. The Georgia Republican has praised QAnon and its baseless premise that former President Donald Trump was secretly battling a global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles. As House Republicans tangled over how to deal with Greene, Democratic leaders kept QAnon front and center. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a press release as \"Q-Calif.,\" in place of the conventional \"R-Calif.\" When Republicans declined to strip Greene of her committee assignments, Democrats (along with 11 Republicans) broke with precedent and voted to remove her themselves. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee unveiled what it called the first ads in the 2022 midterm elections. It targeted seven Republicans, along with McCarthy, as \"too weak to stand up to President Trump and the QAnon mob.\" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., was on the DCCC\u2019s list. The ad featured shots of the mob, many under the QAnon banner, attacking the Capitol. \"Republicans like Brian Fitzpatrick voted to protect Trump letting the QAnon mob win,\" the Feb. 2 ad said. \"Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick should have stood with us, but he was a coward. He stood with Trump and the lies. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. He stood with Q, not you.\" Fitzpatrick won reelection easily in a largely suburban district outside Philadelphia. But Joe Biden carried it with 53% of the vote, a possible reason for Democrats to target the seat. The ad\u2019s core accuracy problem is that while Fitzpatrick in January voted against impeaching Trump, he introduced a resolution to censure the then-president. Months prior, he condemned the QAnon theory in a resolution that won bipartisan support. In September 2020, Fitzpatrick joined two Democrats and two Republicans to cosponsor a House resolution that rejected QAnon and all it stood for. It condemned QAnon for spreading its unfounded belief in a pedophilia ring, and for how it \"expanded to embrace virtually every popular conspiracy theory of the last several decades, from questioning the truth about the September 11th terrorist attacks, to believing in alien landings, to denying the safety of vaccines.\" The resolution noted that the FBI had determined that QAnon likely motivated domestic terrorists. It said QAnon beliefs \"undermine trust in America\u2019s democratic institutions, encourage rejection of objective reality, and deepen our Nation\u2019s political polarization.\" The measure passed Oct. 2 on a 371-18 vote. Fitzpatrick did not support impeaching Trump for inciting the attack on the Capitol. He said impeachment would throttle any hope of unity to help the nation deal with its problem. But he did press for a resolution that would put Congress on record as condemning \"his reprehensible conduct which led to the riots at our nation\u2019s Capitol.\" The resolution blamed Trump for his false claim that \u2018\u2018we won this election, and we won it by a landslide.\" It said Trump\u2019s words \"encouraged \u2014 and foreseeably resulted in \u2014 lawless action at the Capitol.\" It said Trump had betrayed his trust as president, and \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.\" Fitzpatrick offered the resolution along with six other Republican members, but the measure went no further. Fitzpatrick voted against impeachment. Whatever his reason, the vote strengthened Trump\u2019s hand. For the DCCC, this vote was telling. \"Congressman Fitzpatrick had an opportunity to join 10 of his Republican colleagues and vote for the bipartisan articles of impeachment that held President Trump accountable,\" said DCCC communications director Cole Leitner. \"Instead he caved to his president, and now he owns that vote.\" Leiter argued that Fitzpatrick\u2019s actions calling for opposition to QAnon and censure of Trump don\u2019t carry the same weight as impeachment. The condemnation of QAnon was non-binding, and the censure of Trump was stillborn, he said. By contrast, the impeachment vote was a binding resolution of constitutional importance. We reached out to Fitzpatrick\u2019s office and did not hear back. A Democratic ad said Fitzpatrick \"stood with Trump and the lies\u2026 He stood with QAnon, not you.\" Fitzpatrick\u2019s vote against impeachment carried the most legal heft of any of his actions. Regardless of whether Fitzpatrick saw it as supporting Trump, his vote fell on the plus side of the ledger for Trump. But Fitzpatrick publicly criticized Trump. He spoke against the lies of election fraud. He also publicly condemned QAnon. The claim has an element of truth, but mistates other facts. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "claim": "On accepting corporate PAC donations",
        "doc": "During the final weeks of 2020, U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria accepted $34,000 in corporate PAC contributions to pay down debt from her recently successful reelection campaign. Her actions disappointed End Citizens United, a Washington-based public interest group seeking to reform campaign finance laws. It accused her of breaking a pledge not to accept corporate donations. So, we measured on the Flip-O-Meter whether Luria - a Democrat from the 2nd Congressional District anchored in Virginia Beach - has changed her stance on taking corporate contributions. Luria then In 2018, Luria won a Democratic primary for Congress and then narrowly unseated Republican incumbent Scott Taylor in the general election. On April 13, 2018, Luria issued a press release announcing she had been endorsed by End Citizens United. She wrote, \"Our campaign finance system is broken and as a result politicians are listening to corporations and mega-donors instead of the people they were elected to serve. As a naval officer, I took a pledge to put people first and that\u2019s why I am rejecting corporate PAC donations so coastal Virginians will know that I represent them and no one else.\" On April 25, 2018, Luria reacted on Facebook to a New York Times article in which a former congressman said he didn\u2019t talk to lobbyists who hadn\u2019t contributed to his campaign. Luria wrote, \"This kind of pay-to-play governance is unacceptable, that's why I've pledged to reject corporate PAC donations.\" On July 16, 2018, Luria\u2019s campaign put out a news release amplifying that she had raised more money than Taylor, even though Taylor was accepting corporate contributions. \"Elaine pledged to reject corporate PAC contributions and is committed to living her value of reforming campaign finance laws,\" the release said. Luria said during a debate on Oct. 23, 2018, \"I can tell you that a key tenet in my campaign is that I am not accepting any corporate PAC contributions: Not from prescription drug companies, not from oil companies, not from health care companies, not from private prisons, not from anyone who can influence my vote when I go to Washington.\" Luria now Luria defeated Taylor again in a 2020 rematch. We found no record of her mentioning corporate PAC money during the campaign. She did not fill out a questionnaire from End Citizens United and did not, this time, receive the organization\u2019s endorsement. Luria didn\u2019t list any corporate contributions on campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission covering from Jan. 1, 2019 through Nov. 23, 2020 - 20 days after the election. She reported her campaign ended the election $107,161 in debt. Her latest report covers from Nov. 24, 2020 to the end of the year, and was filed with the FEC on Jan. 31, 2021. It shows she accepted during that period $34,000 from 14 corporate PACs to pay down her campaign debt. The donations - ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, came from PACs connected to Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Rolls Royce, Altria, Google, Aflac, BAE Systems, BWX Technologies, McGuireWoods, Ernst & Young, Comcast, iHeartMedia, and Serco. We asked Kate Fegley, Luria\u2019s campaign manager, why the congresswoman changed her stance on corporate PAC contributions. She said Luria\u2019s 2018 pledge not to accept such money was good only for that year\u2019s campaign - not future races. \"Congresswoman Luria took the (End Citizens United) pledge in 2018 and fulfilled that pledge,\" Fegley emailed. \"She did not take the pledge in 2020.\" Fegley wrote that corporate PACs \"are an effective and transparent means for employees to show support for issues important to them and their lines of work through small dollar donations.\" Corporations are forbidden to use operating funds for direct contributions to candidates. Their PACs raise money through employees\u2019 donations. Corporations can, however, pay PAC expenses and executives can sit on boards that direct the PAC\u2019s political donations. Fegley wrote that Luria is still committed to abolishing Super PACs that can raise unlimited and undisclosed contributions from individuals and companies and spend them to advocate for or against candidates. Super PACs are banned from donating directly to a candidate or coordinating their activities with political campaigns. Luria \"is committed to doing the work to root out dark money in our political system and is not beholden to any entity but her constituents,\" Fegley wrote. Our ruling Luria repeatedly vowed in her 2018 congressional campaign she would not accept corporate PAC donations. Then, in the weeks following her 2020 reelection, she took in a total $34,000 from 14 corporate PACs to pay down campaign debt. Her campaign manager\u2019s insistence that Luria\u2019s pledges were only good for her 2018 race is irrelevant. Luria has clearly changed her position on accepting corporate PAC money and we rate it a Full Flop. ",

        "claim": "\u201cA Miracle! Only 23 Americans Tested Positive for Flu Last Week Compared to 14,657 Cases Reported Last Year at Same Time.\u201d",
        "doc": "This headline on an article widely shared on Facebook seemed to drip with sarcasm: \"A Miracle! Only 23 Americans Tested Positive for Flu Last Week Compared to 14,657 Cases Reported Last Year at Same Time.\" The Jan. 31 article from Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, started by asking: \"Do you ever get the feeling you\u2019re being lied to?\" Then it claimed that the number of COVID-19 deaths has been \"over-inflated,\" and it questioned whether the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using \"statistical tricks\" in reporting flu cases. A post sharing the article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We\u2019ve examined and debunked several claims suggesting there have been intentional overcounts of COVID-19 cases, and we thought this claim about flu cases deserved a closer look. Public health experts see a connection between the COVID-19 and flu case numbers, but not the one the article implies. First the numbers, according to a CDC report on Jan. 16, 2021: For the week ended Jan. 16, of the 21,244 flu tests tracked by the CDC, 23 specimens, or 0.1%, tested positive. For the season to that point \u2014 40 weeks, dating back to Sept. 27 \u2014 there were 1,159 positive specimens, or 0.2% of the total tested. \"Flu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months,\" the CDC said in the report. More Week 2 results were released Feb. 5. The new totals show 62 of 38,572 specimens, or 0.16%, tested positive for flu. The headline we\u2019re checking appears to take its second number from a different source: an article on Weather.com. That article compared the 23 cases to 14,657 positive flu tests \u2014 a rate of 29.6% \u2014 in Week 7 of the 2019-20 flu season. That isn\u2019t an apples-to-apples comparison; it compares a week in 2020-21 with a different week in the 2019-20 season. But a direct comparison shows flu cases are down dramatically. During Week 2 of the 2019-20 flu season, 9,277 of the 40,451 specimens were positive for influenza, or 22.9%, according to the CDC. \"We are seeing a lot less influenza activity compared to previous seasons. This does also extend to other respiratory viruses that are usually up during this time of the year,\" said Dr. Werner Bischoff, medical director of Infection Prevention and Health System Epidemiology at the Wake ForestSchool of Medicine. There\u2019s no definitive data yet to explain the drop, but Bischoff and other experts say they suspect that precautions related to the coronavirus, along with high rates of flu vaccination, are helping to limit the spread of the flu. \"My take, and this is not based on any evidence yet, is that the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions with masking, social distancing and frequent hand hygiene really cut down on transmission of these viruses,\" Bischoff said. \"Influenza and most other respiratory viruses are spread by droplets. This combined with the seasonal influenza vaccine may have reduced the spread in the community to such a degree that the viruses have not been able to establish themselves to reach the usual numbers.\" A similar take was relayed in the Weather.com article that Gateway Pundit cited. Weather.com included an excerpt from a Washington Post news story that said the rates of influenza A and influenza B, as well as other viruses, are at record lows, with experts theorizing that is largely due to the global shutdowns, mask wearing and other health protocols aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. \"It is likely that\" COVID-19 mitigation measures have had an impact on influenza,\" said CDC spokesperson RED Denty. \"Measures, including extensive reductions in global travel, teleworking, school closures, social distancing and face mask use may have played a role.\" Other experts have also cited COVID-19 social distancing efforts, including children staying home from school, as well as high rates of influenza vaccinations. A headline from an article widely shared on Facebook claimed: \"A Miracle! Only 23 Americans Tested Positive for Flu Last Week Compared to 14,657 Cases Reported Last Year at Same Time.\" The article cites this drop to suggest that health officials have improperly inflated the number of COVID-19 cases. Flu cases are down dramatically. The CDC reported that only 62 of 38,572 specimens tested positive for influenza for the week ended Jan. 16, 2021. A year earlier, the figure was 9,277. Public health experts say they believe the drop is due not to a miracle or statistical tricks, but largely to social distancing and other precautions being used in response to the coronavirus pandemic. We rate the claim Half True.",

        "claim": "Seniors around the world who died from COVID vaccine are being improperly listed as \u201cnatural causes.\u201d",
        "doc": "Suggesting that coronavirus vaccinations killed 86-year-old Hank Aaron and elderly people in Gibraltar and Norway, an article widely shared on Facebook claims that \"seniors\" around the world died soon after getting vaccinated, and that their cause of death was listed as natural. \"Seniors dying after COVID vaccine labeled as natural causes,\" reads the headline of the article by Dr. Joseph Mercola, a major funder of anti-vaccine efforts. Mercola\u2019s work has come under criticism before from federal agencies and others within the medical community. The full article, which requires a registration to view, begins: \"Around the world, reports are pouring in of people dying shortly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2026 Ironically, when seniors die before vaccination, it\u2019s due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it, but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventive action is necessary.\" The article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article relies on evidentiary assertions that have been widely discredited before. Let\u2019s look. The article says the death Jan. 22 of Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, is notable because he died 17 days after he chose to be vaccinated publicly in hope that other Black people would get the shot. But the Fulton County (Ga.) Medical Examiner\u2019s office said Aaron\u2019s cause of death was natural and not linked to the vaccine. We rated as False a claim that said otherwise. Health Feedback rated as \"misleading\" a separate assertion that Aaron\u2019s death \"is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines.\" The nonprofit fact-checker said there is no evidence to back the claim. Mercola\u2019s article said a surge in deaths in Gibraltar after COVID-19 vaccinations began \"raises questions.\" The article said Gibraltar, the British overseas territory on the southern coast of Spain, had only 10 COVID-related deaths by Jan. 6. But vaccinations began Jan. 9 and by Jan. 17, the article claimed, \"the total death toll had suddenly skyrocketed to 45,\" with most of the people who died during that period being in their 80s or 90s. A Reuters fact-check said a claim that coronavirus deaths in Gibraltar have been caused by the vaccine and not the virus is false, saying there is no evidence linking the deaths to the vaccine. Full Fact reached the same conclusion. The government said in a statement Jan. 27 that 11,073 people had received a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and none had died as a result of receiving it. Six people between the ages of 70 and 100 who died after receiving the vaccine apparently contracted COVID-19 before being vaccinated, but testing did not detect it, according to the statement. In a Feb. 1 announcement, the government encouraged people over age 60 to be vaccinated, noting that \"we have offered the vaccine to almost everyone over the age of 60.\" The article claimed the Norwegian Medicines Agency initially downplayed any connection between the deaths of 29 seniors citizens in the wake of Norway\u2019s \"vaccination push\" \u2014 but that the agency is \"now reconsidering.\" We rated as Mostly False a claim on Facebook that the COVID-19 vaccine is dangerous because 23 people died in Norway \"within hours\" of receiving it. Those who died were very frail nursing home residents with serious underlying illnesses. The inoculation was not determined to be the cause of death. Since then, in its latest weekly report on adverse reactions to the vaccinations, the agency said Feb. 2 that among the 112,000 people who have received the first dose and 22,000 who have received the second, there were 56 deaths \"with a temporal link to vaccination.\" All occurred among nursing home residents over age 70 within 12 days of vaccination. \"Many of these reports state that no link to vaccination is suspected. The fact that some nursing home residents die soon after being vaccinated does not mean that there is a causal relationship,\" the report said. \"Every day, an average of 45 people die in Norwegian nursing homes or other similar institutions. It is therefore to be expected that deaths will occur soon after vaccination, without there necessarily being any causal link to the vaccine.\" The agency also said in the report: \"The benefits of administering the vaccine are considered to outweigh any possible risks.\" A COVID-19 subcommittee of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, an advisory body to the World Health Organization, reviewed information on deaths reported in frail, elderly individuals in Europe who had received the Pfizer vaccine. In a statement Jan. 22, the subcommittee said, \"The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events.\" An article widely shared on Facebook claimed that seniors died soon after getting a COVID-19 vaccination and their cause of death was improperly listed as natural. The article cited the deaths of 86-year-old Hank Aaron and several dozen elderly people in Gibraltar and Norway, all of whom died within a couple of weeks of receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. There is no evidence that the vaccines caused any of the deaths. Aaron\u2019s death was ruled natural, and authorities in Gibraltar and Norway said none of the deaths of elderly people they investigated were caused by the vaccines. We rate the claim False.",

        "doc": "A post circulating in liberal corners of social media pushes back against Republicans\u2019 portrayal of President Joe Biden as someone who is going to impose big tax hikes. \"Wait, so Trump passed a bill in 2017 where people who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027 \u2026 while the rich get richer \u2026 and y\u2019all crying about Biden raising taxes for people who make over 400k. What am I missing....,\" the post said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The assertion about impending tax increases under the 2017 law got a boost on Feb. 1, when the liberal group Occupy Democrats posted it on its Facebook page. There, it got at least 25,000 reactions over the next three days. When we looked into it, we found that the notion of a continuing series of tax increases buried in the GOP-backed law is misleading. (We inquired with Occupy Democrats, but we did not hear back.) Generally speaking, analyses of the 2017 law by independent groups have found the opposite of what the post says \u2014 that, at least until 2027, when a lot of the tax cuts will have expired, all income groups will see a reduction in taxes (or an increase in after-tax income). In their \"distributional tables\" \u2014 the analytical charts that show how much a typical taxpayer in a given income group will see their after-tax income rise or fall under the law \u2014 both the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation concluded that until 2027, taxpayers across the income spectrum will fare better under the 2017 law than they would have otherwise. Some income groups will save more money than others do, and results for individual taxpayers will vary depending on the nature of their income; these tables are based on averages. However, there\u2019s one analysis, from Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation, that doesn\u2019t show this pattern, and it\u2019s the one that the post relies on. The discrepancy stems from a difference in the assumptions that went into each analysis. Unlike other analyses, the Joint Committee\u2019s factored in the law\u2019s provision eliminating the tax penalty for not having health insurance, and it did so in a counterintuitive way. Under the committee\u2019s longstanding principles, it treats the elimination of this penalty as a net tax increase \u2014 not a net decrease. Why? The logic is that in the absence of a mandate to have health insurance, more people would forgo buying it on the marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act. As a result, fewer people would get the tax subsidies that come with buying insurance on the marketplaces. These subsidies are meant to help people afford their insurance premiums. The practical effect of this analytical approach is that, in the distributional tables, some lower- and moderate-income groups see their income gains from the 2017 tax law disappear \u2014 a sharp contrast from what the Tax Policy Center and Tax Foundation concluded. As an example, here\u2019s the Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s table that compares the tax burdens in 2023, both before and after the law\u2019s passage: The chart shows that while most income groups will see a tax cut in 2023 as a result of the law, both the collective tax burden and the average tax rate for households earning up to $30,000 are set to rise. The same pattern holds in 2025, extending that year to taxpayers earning up to $40,000. And in 2027, after a host of tax cuts in the bill expire, the range of taxpayers expands to those earning as much as $75,000. Tax experts say that the approach of the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation \u2014 which doesn\u2019t factor in the change in the health insurance penalty \u2014 is a more accurate reading of the tax rates set down in the 2017 law. The decision process that leads to fewer tax subsidies does not amount to having \"their taxes raised,\" as the Facebook post said. \"While it is important to consider the impact of the (tax law) on premium tax credits and health insurance take-up, it is misleading to call this effect a \u2018stealth tax increase,\u2019\" wrote Garrett Watson in a post for the Tax Foundation, where he is a senior tax policy analyst. \"The decline in premium tax credits has nothing to do with a change in tax rates or the generosity of the credits as established under the (Affordable Care Act), but rather due to voluntary decisions individuals make about whether to purchase qualified health insurance.\" The post said, \"Trump passed a bill in 2017 where people who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\" Tables produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation do suggest that after-tax incomes for some income groups will decline, but it\u2019s misleading to say that this amounts to having \"their taxes raised.\" These tax increases show up in the tables because the committee concluded that eliminating the individual health insurance mandate would lead people to forgo buying insurance, and would in turn reduce the tax subsidies they would\u2019ve received to help them pay their premiums. By contrast, at least two other independent groups ignored the impact of this provision in their analyses and concluded that every income group will benefit from the tax law to some degree each year until 2027. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d",
        "doc": "An article from the conservative news website The Gateway Pundit claims that a video from the TCF Center where Detroit election workers counted absentee ballots cast by the city\u2019s voters \"shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\" The article claims that the video is \"proof of fraud in Detroit.\" The video appears to show a white van at the TCF Center early in the morning on Nov. 4 containing ballots that were unloaded and brought into the counting room at the TCF Center. There is no evidence of anything nefarious. In Michigan, voters had until 8 p.m. on Election Day to return absentee ballots. The deadline was for casting ballots, not delivering or counting them. A sworn affidavit written by Christopher Thomas, the former Michigan Director of Elections who worked at the TCF Center, in response to a lawsuit against the city says that no late-arriving ballots were ever counted. \"No absentee ballots received after the deadline of 8 p.m. on November 3, 2020, were received by or processed at the TCF Center. Only ballots received by the deadline were processed,\" Thomas wrote. Many Republican challengers present at the TCF Center have said that they observed ballots being dropped off at the TCF Center in the middle of the night. Thomas wrote that their accounts do not support the claim that thousands of ballots cast after the 8 p.m. deadline were counted. Detroit voters could return absentee ballots by mail to the clerk\u2019s office, in-person or utilize one of the city\u2019s many ballot drop boxes until that deadline. Ballots were collected until 8 p.m. on election night after which point all ballots were returned and processed by the clerk\u2019s staff. The staff then verified signatures at the Department of Elections. Only after ballots were validated were they delivered to the TCF Center for election workers to process and tabulate them. Shane Trejo, a writer for the right-wing website Big League Politics, told the Gateway Pundit that he was at the TCF Center where he said he witnessed thousands of ballots being unloaded early Wednesday morning. \"There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 a.m., well after the 8:00 p.m. deadline for ballots to show up.\" The 8 p.m. deadline was for voters to return ballots, not for ballots to be delivered to the TCF Center. Trejo has previously made false claims of election fraud in Detroit, prompting Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to ask Trejo to take down misleading videos he posted. In his affidavit, Thomas explained that early in the morning on Wednesday, approximately 16,000 ballots in 45 trays containing approximately 350 ballots each were delivered in a white van used by the city. \"The ballots delivered to the TCF Center had been verified by the City Clerk\u2019s staff prior to delivery in a process prescribed by Michigan law. \u2026 It would have been impossible for any election worker at the TCF Center to count or process a ballot for someone who was not an eligible voter or whose ballot was not received by the 8:00 p.m. deadline on November 3, 2020,\" Thomas wrote. In his opinion in the lawsuit against the city denying the request to delay the certification of the election, Wayne County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Kenny determined that the lawsuit\u2019s account of fraud and misconduct \u2014 including its assertion that late-arriving ballots were illegally counted \u2014 was \"incorrect and not credible.\" An article by the Gateway Pundit claims that a \"newly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\" Detroit election officials have confirmed that ballots were delivered to the TCF Center early Wednesday morning but that those ballots met the 8 p.m. deadline for voters to return them and had been verified by the city clerk\u2019s office as legally cast.

        "claim": "Says that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d",
        "doc": "John Kerry, President Joe Biden's new special envoy on climate,appeared on CNN Jan. 31to lay out the Biden administration\u2019s whole-of-government approach to addressing climate change. Thecost of takingnoactionon climate changewill far outweigh thepriceof preventing its worst-case scenario,Kerryargued,pointingto threerecentstorms\u2014 hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma \u2014whose damages cost the U.S.a combined $265 billion. And thenKerrythrew out a striking detail: \"Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,\" he said. It\u2019s true that Hurricane Harvey produced rainfalllevelsthat have never been experienced in the U.S. in recorded history. According to Texas State Climatologist John Nielson-Gammon,the amount of rainfall that fell duringafive-dayperiodacross 10,000 square milesof Texas and Louisianaexceeded the previous record set in 1899 by 62%. In Harris County alone,which contains the bulk of the city of Houston,the storm droppedan average 33.7 inches of rainfall across the county\u2019s 1,777 square mile area.But is thatamountofrainfall more thanthe volume of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a full year? A spokesperson for theU.S. Department of State said that Kerry\u2019s remark was based on a2017Washington Post articlereporting that Harvey had dumped24.5trillion gallons of wateron Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana. The article also mentions, for comparisonsake, that 1 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Fallsevery15 days, and Kerry\u2019s office used that number to extrapolate the amount of water that flows over the falls in a year. \"A trillion gallons falls over Niagara Falls every 15 days. So, in the course of 365 days, that is about 24.3 trillion gallons of water,\" saidstate departmentspokesperson James Dewey. That back-of-the-envelopecalculationis correct, and it closely lines up withofficial estimates. Niagara Falls State Park estimates that757,500 gallons flow over the falls each second, which is equivalent to 65.4 billion gallons per day, or23.8 trillion gallons per year. In either case \u2014 be it Kerry\u2019s estimate of 24.3 trillion gallonsflowing over Niagaraper year or the state park\u2019s 23.8 billionestimate\u2014 bothfiguresare less than the 24.5 trillion gallons of water Harveyunleashed. However, there\u2019s akeydetailthatKerry gets wrong. While it might be true that Hurricane Harveydropped more water within a week than flows over Niagara Falls in a year, not all of that Harvey waterfell on Houston or Harris County alone. Harvey made landfall near Rockport on Aug. 25, 2017, then drifted eastward over the next several days, dropping torrential rain on the Houston metro area.Three days later, the storm\u2019s center moved back offshore andrestrengthenedover Matagorda Baywhere itgainedits peak intensity. Then on Aug. 30,the storm made landfall again insouthwesternLouisianamovingnortheastward over thesouthern United States while continuing to produceheavy rainfall. The majority of thestorm\u2019s total rainfallfell overSoutheast Texas, where 60 counties were under a disaster declaration, and southern Louisiana, where 13 counties were under a disaster declaration.The storm grew weaker as it moved over Tennesseeand Kentucky, where itfinally dissipated. Countiesin both states issued flash flood warnings as areas received up to 7 inches of rain. All told, the storm had unleashed a grand total of 33 trilliongallons of water. Kerry\u2019s statement would havebeenaccurate if he had said Harvey dropped more water on Texas and Louisiana, or the southern U.S., overfivedays\u2014 instead of just Houston \u2014than the amount that flows over Niagara Falls in a year. A 2018 report by the Harris County Flood Control District also made acomparison between the amount of Harvey rainfall and the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls. \"A total of 1 trillion gallons of water fell across Harris County over the 4 day period which would fill NRG Stadium 1,472 times and cover Harris County\u2019s 1,777 sq. miles with an average of 33.7 inches of water. This volume of water would also run Niagara Falls for 15 days,\" the report said. After PolitiFact reached out toKerry\u2019soffice about the misstatement,a spokesperson saidthat the issue has been broughtup to staff and that Kerry wouldbe more careful with that statistic. \"In a recent interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, Secretary Kerry said Hurricane Harvey 'dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,'\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"The statistic Secretary Kerry referenced is for water Hurricane Harvey dropped not just on Houston, but on southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.\" Kerry said on CNN that Hurricane Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five daysthan the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a year. By the time Harvey dissipated it had dropped around 33 trillion gallons of waterprimarily onTexas, Louisianaand, to a lesser extent,Tennessee and Kentucky.By comparison, about 23.8 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls per year. Kerry\u2019s comment errsin narrowing Harvey rainfall to Houston, and his office acknowledged the misstatement.In fact, 1 trillion gallons were dumped on Harris County, which would be equivalent to the volume of water that spills over Niagara Falls in 15 days.

        "claim": "States are seeing increases in revenue, with an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019. Over half of states report positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.",
        "doc": "A fundamental disagreement over the latest COVID-19 relief plan centers on aid to states, cities and counties. Democrats plan to include about $350 billion in aid, and Republicans argue that not only is the money unnecessary, it\u2019s just a way to reward to liberal states. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said Democrats are lying about the need. \"States across the country are seeing increases in revenue \u2014 in some cases, well above projections,\" Scott said in a Feb. 1 statement. \"Now, we are learning that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12% compared to 2019, and 21 of the 47 states show positive year over year growth of tax receipts. Over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.\" Is the revenue picture as rosy as Scott makes it out to be? One study partially backs up Scott\u2019s numbers, but he made some errors. Other compilations of state financial reports show the situation is worse than he presents. And if it weren\u2019t for one state \u2014 California \u2014 the numbers would look even more dire. Scott\u2019s own state, Florida, was among the biggest revenue losers. Scott\u2019s staff pointed to a J.P. Morgan weekly market report. The investment bank\u2019s analysts aimed to give bond investors a sense of the ability of states to repay bonds. Scott drew on that work virtually word for word. He accurately reflected the findings that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019, and 21 of 47 states show positive year-over-year growth in tax receipts. (The study had a full-year of data on 37 states, and 11 months for another 10.) But Scott proceeded to muddle the numbers. After noting that revenues rose in 21 states, he then said \"over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York and Illinois.\" Clearly, 21 is fewer than half of the 50 states. The first statistic he cited in his claim \u2014 21 \u2014 relates to total tax revenues. The second \u2014 half of states \u2014 relates to personal income taxes alone. Scott failed to note the difference. The J.P. Morgan report said personal income tax revenues rose in over half of the states where it had data, including the three states Scott named. But in terms of total revenues, only California saw its numbers go up. New York was down 1.5% and Illinois was down 0.9%. Half a dozen states suffered far deeper revenue drops. The worst hit include Nevada (-13%), North Dakota (-9.7%), Florida (-7.9%), Texas (-6.8%), West Virginia (-6.8%) and Oklahoma (-6.7%). The J.P. Morgan report\u2019s time frame bears a mention. It includes two full months in 2020 before the coronavirus cratered the economy. Other research gives a window into the virus\u2019 fiscal impact in the pandemic months between March and December. Based on budget reports from 46 states, researcher Lucy Dadayan at the Urban Institute, an academic center in Washington, D.C., told us that from March through December, revenues from personal and corporate income taxes and sales taxes fell by 1.6% from the same period a year earlier. That decline might seem small, but it is more than 10 times larger than the 0.12% Scott referred to. In raw dollars, it represents $12.6 billion in lost revenue. Aggregate numbers conceal as much as they reveal, and California was an outlier with a hefty effect on the overall numbers. Thanks to a variety of factors, including large year-end bonuses and massive tax withholding tied to initial stock offerings of companies like Airbnb, California\u2019s revenues shot up 26.5% in December alone. That was enough to make the national picture look considerably better. When Dadayan pulled the Golden State out of the equation, total revenues across the remaining states were down 2%. That\u2019s 25% worse than when California was included. There are other ways to measure the fiscal impact of COVID-19. The National Association of State Budget Officers gets information from all 50 states, but those numbers are for fiscal, not calendar, years. In most cases, that runs from July through June. The time frame is different, but the numbers are similar to Dadayan\u2019s figures. In their fiscal years that ended in 2020, states collected $14 billion less than the year before. And in their budgets for fiscal year 2021, states factored in an additional decline of $39 billion, for a total reduction of $53 billion over the two years. Dadayan said that before the coronavirus, accounting for population and economic growth, states had planned on a rise of about 5% in revenues each year. The National Association of State Budget Officers said that compared with those pre-COVID-19 budget forecasts, revenues will be down by $135 billion. To help close part of the gap, states drew down their emergency funds by $12.2 billion. Scott\u2019s focus on how much money states are collecting leaves out half the fiscal picture \u2014 the spending side. In the face of falling revenues, states cut spending on schools, roads and many other areas. The National Association of State Budget Officers reported that education spending fell by $7.4 billion. Another $5.6 billion came from a range of programs, including public safety, the judiciary, environmental protection and aid to local governments. Modest declines in state revenue can have more pronounced effects on county and city budgets that rely on state aid. The Democratic plan that Scott criticized would also send aid to cities and counties. A survey of county officials during the summer found most counties were seeing budget shortfalls, and nearly three-quarters of them were holding back on capital spending and county services. The National League of Cities reported that overall city revenues have fallen 21% since the start of the pandemic, while expenses have risen 17%. Chicago alone reported a nearly $800 million general fund deficit at the end of August. Dadayan said the focus on state revenues \"misses the fiscal stress on local governments, which is a lot bigger compared to state revenue shortfalls.\" She added that cities are looking at budget gaps estimated at more than $90 billion. Scott said states across the country are seeing increases in revenue with an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019. He also said that over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois. Scott faithfully reflects a report from J.P. Morgan in terms of the 0.12% overall decline, but he went astray when talking about states with higher revenues, particularly the three states he named. The J.P. Morgan report said revenues grew only in California. They fell in New York and Illinois. Scott\u2019s numbers included two months before the pandemic began. Focusing on the pandemic months of March through December, revenues fell about 10 times more than Scott said. He also limited his view of fiscal health to state revenues. Factoring in spending cuts, and impacts on city and county finances, the picture is much worse. Scott used a report that gave a limited view of a broader fiscal landscape, and misread an element in the report itself. The information he left out would leave a reader with a different impression. That matches our definition of Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Says North Carolina bill to require in-person learning is \u201cstripping out some of the health protocols that are in place.\u201d",
        "doc": "Gov. Roy Cooper says he wants North Carolina school boards to reopen in-person instruction on their own, rather than be forced by state lawmakers. Republican legislators recently introduced a bill that would require county school boards to offer the option of in-person classes. When a reporter asked Cooper about it during a press conference on Tuesday, he said he hadn\u2019t read the bill yet. \"I haven\u2019t seen the legislation, (but) I know about it,\" Cooper said. \"I have some concerns with it, particularly stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place.\" Is it true that the GOP bill would \"strip\" some current safety protocols that are already in place? The bill would strip school boards of flexibility. (They would no longer be allowed to offer remote-only instruction, unless there\u2019s a COVID outbreak.) However, the bill itself does not automatically strip schools of any health protocols for in-person learning. In North Carolina, Cooper is giving public school boards some flexibility to choose how they want to reopen. He\u2019s laid out three levels of operation: Plan A: minimal social distancing. Plan B: moderate social distancing. Plan C: full remote learning. (There are specific protocols to follow for each plan. For the sake of brevity, we won\u2019t get into those details just yet.) So far, Cooper has given only elementary schools the ability to enact Plan A. Middle and high schools can only choose Plan B or Plan C. The Republican bill would require all public schools to offer Plan A or Plan B, while allowing parents the ability to still choose a remote alternative. Cooper\u2019s use of the word \"strip\" could give parents the impression the bill would change health protocols that are already in place. The bill does not aim to do that. The bill requires schools to follow protocols laid out in the \"Strong Schools NC Public Health Toolkit\" that was developed by the health department, led by Cooper-appointee Mandy Cohen, as well as the Department of Public Instruction. The original bill told school boards to follow toolkit guidance that \"existed on December 4, 2020.\" On Wednesday, the Senate amended the bill to ensure schools follow the latest version of the toolkit, which was updated on Feb. 2. Cooper said Tuesday that 90 out of North Carolina\u2019s 115 school districts already provide some in-person instruction. Consider for a moment that your school district is already operating under a Plan B model of in-person learning. PolitiFact found no evidence that, if the bill were enacted, health protocols for Plan B would be significantly different from what they are now. Of course, if the bill is enacted and school boards are able to choose Plan A, one could argue that would \"strip\" teachers of existing protections. Plan A and Plan B are similar in some ways. Both require schools to mandate face coverings, conduct regular screenings for coronavirus symptoms, limit visitors, mark the floors to guide movement, and more. (Page 5 of the toolkit features a chart showing how the plans track on 10 out of 11 key guidelines.) However, there are a few protocols required in Plan B that aren\u2019t required under Plan A, including: Mandating 6 feet of physical distance, Banning more than one passenger per bus seat, Restricting carpooling to family members. To be clear, these differences are not insignificant. While in December experts found in-school coronavirus spread to be low, experts have also repeatedly confirmed that social distancing and spacing are key to limiting spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers in-person learning with minimal social distancing to be the highest-risk learning model. On MSNBC this week, the CDC director reiterated that schools can open safely only if they continued social distancing. Cooper said a Republican bill that would require counties to enact in-person learning is \"stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place.\" He\u2019s right that the bill would \"strip\" school boards of the ability to offer remote learning exclusively. Also, if the bill is enacted and local school boards opt for Plan A, one could argue that teachers would be stripped of their social distancing protection. However, a parent whose child attends a school operating under Plan B may hear Cooper\u2019s comments and think the Republican bill would remove some health protocols that are already in place. That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. Bill sponsors say the intention is for schools to continue operating under the guidelines outlined by the Cooper administration.

        "claim": "\"The (Erie Co., N.Y.) health commissioner makes more than the governor, the vice president of the United States, and has a salary that is comparable to Dr. Anthony Fauci.\u201d",
        "doc": "How well-paid is Dr. Gale Burstein, the health commissioner of Erie County, N.Y.? According to Erie County Comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, Burstein rivals Dr. Anthony Fauci, the long-tenured federal official who is playing a key role combating the coronavirus. In 2020, Burstein\u2019s compensation, when factoring in fringe benefits, reached $532,418, based on a new report produced by Mychajliw\u2019s office. \"I think a lot of people are going to be very angry that the health commissioner makes more than the governor, the vice president of the United States, and has a salary that is comparable to Dr. Anthony Fauci,\" Mychajliw said, according to the Buffalo News. Could a county-wide official really be out-earning such lofty officials? We took a closer look. Government administrators generally do not receive overtime pay. In a normal, pandemic-free year, Burstein would have made $202,312 in base salary, and a total of $304,985 when benefits are included. However, starting in 2020, Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz allowed all non-union, managerial, confidential employees to accept overtime pay for their work related to the coronavirus, the Buffalo News reported. The report found that during 2020, Burstein collected $183,414 for 1,266 hours of overtime work and $44,019 in fringe benefits on this overtime, not including health insurance. This made her the largest single recipient of taxpayer-funded overtime in Erie County, which includes Buffalo. In a statement, Erie County executive Mark C. Poloncarz verified Burstein\u2019s earnings and added that Burstein is \"performing two full-time jobs.\" Mychajliw said that including Burstein\u2019s overtime pay, her 2020 salary places her among the highest paid officials not just in the state but the federal government as well. Jessica O\u2019Neil, Mychajliw\u2019s associate deputy comptroller and chief of staff, directed PolitiFact reporters to the Erie County budget and several articles showing the salary of top government officials. For the governor of New York, O\u2019Neil cited an article in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle that said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's annual salary is set to rise to $250,000 in 2021. However, Cuomo chose to defer his scheduled $25,000 pay raise and asked other statewide officials to do the same, citing economic hardships. Cuomo had been set to see his annual salary increase from $225,000 to $250,000 on Jan. 1 as part of a three-year pay schedule approved by state lawmakers in 2019. This deferral will ultimately mean Cuomo will make the same salary \u2014 $225,000 \u2014 in 2021 as he did in 2020. Former Vice President Mike Pence earned $230,700 in 2019, and that was set to increase to $235,100 in 2020 as a result of the expiration of a pay freeze. Finally, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to the president, made $417,608 in wages 2019, which is the latest year in which federal salaries were available via the Freedom of Information Act. So Burstein\u2019s total salary plus overtime in 2020 was $385,726, which easily beats the number for Cuomo and Pence. Once benefits are added in, her total compensation package of $532,418 beats Fauci as well. The caveat is that Pence and Cuomo, and possibly Fauci, receive perks that are difficult to value, and which may leave Burstein\u2019s compensation in the dust. The vice president lived rent-free in a 9,150-square-foot Victorian mansion at Number One Observatory Circle, plus access to Air Force Two, a large security detail, and free food prepared by the executive chef and executive pastry chef at the White House, among several other benefits. Meanwhile, Cuomo gets the benefit of living arrangements at the New York State Executive Mansion and transportation via taxpayer funded planes and helicopters. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that Burstein\u2019s income will decrease when and if the special pandemic compensation rules are rolled back. Mychajliw said, \"I think a lot of people are going to be very angry that the health commissioner makes more than the governor, the vice president of the United States, and has a salary that is comparable to Dr. Anthony Fauci.\" Burstein is benefitting from a rule that allows her to collect overtime, and she\u2019s working more hours because of the pandemic. So Burstein\u2019s salary and overtime alone exceeded the easily classifiable compensation for Cuomo and Pence, and when benefits are added in, she beats Fauci as well. However, Cuomo and Pence receive housing, transportation, and security benefits that are large but hard to quantify, and if these benefits are added into the calculation, they likely exceed what Burstein received.

It goes on to say that \"US Special Op forces recovered bodies, body parts and at least a hundred surviving children from a tunnel system beneath the White House and Capitol Building in Washington DC\" on Jan. 29.

It describes \"at least a hundred children\" seen coming out of the White House with military troops and body bags in the early morning hours of that day. Such an event would be widely covered in the media. But there are no news reports or photographs to corroborate what is an outlandish and unsubstantiated allegation.

        "claim": "\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"",
        "doc": "In a solo performance that began in the stands and ended on the field inside Raymond James Stadium, The Weeknd ran through his biggest hits for Super Bowl LV\u2019s halftime show. Over 14 minutes, the R&B star performed a medley of his top songs before a live audience of 24,700 in Tampa, Fla. and millions of viewers at home. The event inspired a lot of memes and, as we found, fueled misinformation online, with some social media users falsely claiming The Weeknd used the NFL\u2019s platform for a tribute to Satan. \"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual,\" said the text in several viral Facebook posts, which shared screenshots of a tweet that has since been deleted. (A similar tweet from the same account remains up; it says, \"Satan flashed in the ritual.\") The Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The posts rely on a photo that shows the word \"Satan\" flashed in red lights behind The Weeknd as he performed on stage. The photo is real, but it wasn\u2019t captured during Super Bowl LV. In reality, the \"Satan\" incident took place during a 2017 concert The Weeknd gave in Copenhagen, Denmark, as other fact-checkers also reported. Several minutes into his performance of the song \"Reminder,\" the word flashed briefly on a screen behind him, videos posted to YouTube show. A 2017 YouTube video highlighting what happened in 2017 also circulated widely on Facebook in the wake of The Weeknd\u2019s Super Bowl performance on Feb. 7. We can\u2019t say why the word \"Satan\" was used at the 2017 concert, despite searching for a credible explanation online. But we can say the word did not appear during his Super Bowl halftime show. False claims about Satan often align with the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which holds among other beliefs that the world is run by powerful people who belong to a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles. We rate these Facebook posts False.",

        "claim": "\u201cDoctor proves masks don\u2019t work\u201d by vaping through them.",
        "doc": "In a video clip being shared on Facebook, a retired anesthesiologist who rails against mask wearing to protect against COVID-19 purports to demonstrate their ineffectiveness by blowing out the vapor from an electronic cigarette. The video carries the headline: \"Doctor proves masks \u2018don\u2019t work.\u2019\" But he doesn\u2019t prove that at all. The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don\u2019t protect against passing the coronavirus. After all, people breathe in and out with masks on. \"By that illogic, the fact that air can pass through a mask could be cited as \u2018evidence\u2019as well,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, called the video \"completely misleading.\" \"Fabric and surgical/procedure masks are meant to help protect against larger droplet particles that may contain COVID-19,\" she said. \"You have to be able to breathe through a mask, and he is just blowing out water vapor, so that is expected to be able to go through a mask.\" The Facebook post that includes the video clip was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video is by Dr. Ted Noel, a former Florida anesthesiologist. Noel allowed his license to expire in 2014 after deciding to retire, the Florida Department of Health told us. Noel\u2019s YouTube channel has more than 19,000 subscribers and has had more than 9 million views since it was started in 2016. In the three-minute clip, Noel blows e-cigarette vapor through a variety of masks, including a surgical-style mask and a cloth mask like those commonly worn to control the spread of COVID-19. When we asked Noel to back his position, he argued in an email that COVID-19 is spread by aerosols, and that 90% of aerosols and viruses \"go right through\" cloth masks. He also argued that\"basically, the only way droplets can spread COVID-19 is if an ill person happens to be quite close to an uninfected person who happens to be breathing in at the exact moment that the ill person expels the droplets.\" Noel has repeatedly railed against masks. On Jan. 31, he wrote: \"Most Americans intuitively recognize that masks don\u2019t reduce infections. But they go along with the virtue signaling to be good citizens.\" In his email, he called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, \"a lab rat turned bureaucrat who plays a doctor on TV.\" Noel's claimson countering the spread of the coronavirus are contradicted by public health experts. The clip demonstrates that \"to work properly, even the best masks or respirators need to fit properly, without gaps, and not everything that looks like a really good mask necessarily has good filtration,\" said Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Medical Center. But \"it is a leap to go from there to generalizing that \u2018masks don\u2019t work,\u2019\" he said. Many peer-reviewed studies show \"that masks do have a significant effect. They do work, when used properly.\" CDC guidance allows that the protection afforded by a mask depends on the type of mask and the nature of the substance in the air \u2014 whether it\u2019s liquid droplets, gaseous vapor, or solid particles like soot or pollen. For example, cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 offer little protection against the tiny particles of wildfire smoke, the CDC said when addressing wildfires and COVID-19 in the summer of 2020. But, as Prins said, it\u2019s the larger respiratory droplets that are the concern with COVID-19. The primary way people get COVID-19 is exposure to respiratory droplets that carry the virus, the CDC reiterated in a research brief in October 2020. The droplets can be transmitted between people through touch or through the air, typically when people are less than 6 feet apart. Measures such as mask wearing, social distancing and hand hygiene \"appear sufficient to address transmission both through close contact and under the special circumstances favorable to potential airborne transmission,\" the brief said. \"Multi-layer cloth masks block release of exhaled respiratory particles into the environment, along with the microorganisms these particles carry,\" the CDC said in a November 2020 research brief. \"Cloth masks not only effectively block most large droplets, but they can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles, also often referred to as aerosols.\" The CDC recommends that people wear masks \"in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people\" to slow the spread of COVID-19, because masks provide a barrier that keeps the respiratory droplets from spreading between people. On Jan. 29, the CDC ordered that masks be worn on public conveyances, such as airplanes, subways, buses and cabs, and in transportation hubs such as airports and bus stations. A widely shared Facebook post that includes a video clip claims that a \"doctor proves masks don\u2019t work\" by showing vapor from an electronic cigarette passing through a mask. Experts say the fact that masks allow e-cigarette vapor to pass through provides no evidence to back the claim. They say face coverings offer protection against COVID-19 by blocking larger respiratory droplets, as well as aerosols, that can carry the virus and pass between people. The CDC and other public health experts recommend mask wearing. We rate the claim False. UPDATED, Feb. 9, 11 a.m. ET: This story was updated to include additional context on how masks work.",

But a recent Facebook post blames Biden for layoffs that were announced before he even won the presidential election. \"SHELL OIL laying off 9000 workers,\" reads the Feb. 8 post. \"Thanks Biden.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Curtis Smith, a spokesperson for Shell, told us this isn\u2019t accurate. In September, Smith said, Shell announced up to 9,000 positions would be eliminated \"as part of a broader effort to reduce costs, simplify the company\u2019s structure and accelerate investments in lower-carbon energy products.\" News reports at the time echo this, and they don\u2019t mention Biden. On Sept. 21, Reuters reported that the company wanted to cut up to 40% off the cost of producing oil and gas as it tries to focus more on renewable energy and power markets. The move followed similar steps taken by its European rivals, BP and ENI, which also plan to reduce their focus on oil and gas and build new low-carbon businesses, according to Reuters. Shell said in April that it would become a net-zero emissions company by 2050. The job cuts will range from 7,000 to 9,000 workers by the end of 2022, according to Business Insider. Shell\u2019s CEO has said there are \"too many layers in the company\" and that it is \"looking to remove that complexity, and cost.\" We rate this Facebook post False.",

        "claim": "\u201cNow (Biden) is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine.\u201d",
        "doc": "During aFeb. 2 interview on Fox News, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La.,claimed President Joe Biden was allowing unauthorized immigrants to move ahead of American citizens to get their covid-19 vaccines. \"Now (Biden)is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine,\" said Scalise,the No. 2 Republican leader in the House. Lauren Fine, a spokesperson for Scalise, said the representative was referring to a Feb. 1 statement from the Department of Homeland Security. It said the agency \"encourages all individuals, regardless of immigration status, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine once eligible under local distribution guidelines.\" Since supply is limited, wrote Fine in an emailed statement, \"for every vaccine an illegal immigrant gets, that\u2019s one an American citizen waiting in line is not getting. If you\u2019re an American citizen that\u2019s currently in a group that can\u2019t get the vaccine yet, you\u2019re now behind in the line to an illegal immigrant in a group that can get one.\" Considering the DHS statement, other press statements and executive plans, the Biden administration has certainly been vocal about its position that all immigrants should be able to get this shot. But, we wondered, does allowing this population access to the vaccine mean they are being invited to step in front of American citizens in the queue? We asked the experts. The Biden administration released a national COVID-19 strategy plan during the president\u2019s first week in office. The administration, according to the document, is \"committed to ensuring that safe, effective, cost-free vaccines are available to the entire U.S. public \u2014 regardless of their immigration status.\" The plan directs federal agencies to take action to ensure everyone living in the U.S. can access the vaccine free of charge and without cost sharing. During a Jan. 28 press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration feels \"that ensuring that all people in the United States \u2014 undocumented immigrants, as well, of course \u2014 receive access to a vaccine, because that, one, is morally right, but also ensures that people in the country are also safe.\" The DHS statement also specified that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency wouldn\u2019t conduct enforcement operations at or near vaccination sites or clinics. The Biden administration didn\u2019t respond to a request to clarify its position on unauthorized immigrants\u2019 access to vaccines in relation to Scalise\u2019s claim. But, based on publicly available information, it is clear the administration wants immigrants to have access to the vaccine. However, no statement or provision in the administration\u2019s policies indicates they should \"jump\" ahead of other Americans. Public health experts across the board criticized Scalise for his statement, in effect saying he was missing the point. \"The line is not drawn by your immigration or legal status,\" saidDr. Ranit Mishori, senior medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights, a nonprofit that investigates the health consequences of human rights violations. \"It\u2019s drawn by your vulnerability, your potential for exposure and your risk.\" Jeffrey Levi, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, said Scalise\u2019s claim misrepresents what Biden is trying to do. \"They are simply saying that if an immigrant falls within a category that is currently prioritized (e.g., a health care worker or someone over a certain age), they should not be excluded from getting the vaccine,\" Levi wrote in an email. \"It does not put an immigrant ahead of a prioritized category.\" Samantha Artiga, director of racial equity and health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy organization, had a similar take. (Kaiser Health Newsis an editorially independent program of KFF). \"The policies clarify that all people in the U.S. are eligible for vaccinations regardless of their immigration status and encourage immigrants to get vaccinated when they become eligible based on their local guidelines,\" she wrote in an email. \"They do not prioritize immigrants.\" Dr. Jeffrey Singer, a senior fellow in health policy with the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank, said the Biden plan is just following standard public health policy and epidemiological principles. \"Trying to place an emphasis on immigration status might be a good way to press people\u2019s buttons to get a sound bite on television,\" said Singer. \"But immigration status is really irrelevant when we\u2019re prioritizing people. It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from. If you\u2019re here in the U.S., you should get vaccinated.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended in December that states should first prioritize vaccinating health care workers and residents and staff members of long-term care facilities. The next priority group, according to ACIP, should be people ages 75 and older and other front-line essential workers who are not in health care. The Biden administration also recently recommended the age category be lowered to include all seniors, age 65 and older. However, states are free to create their own vaccine distribution plans and decide what groups will get vaccinated first. Unauthorized immigrants make up significant percentages of the workforces deemed \"essential\" by ACIP. For example,KFF reports that noncitizens (a broad group that could include immigrants in the country lawfully) constitute 22% of all food production workers, 8% of workers in long-term care facilities and 5% of health care workers who have direct patient contact. The Migration Policy Institute estimated in a February report the number of unauthorized immigrants who qualify as essential workers ranges from 1.1 million to 5.6 million, depending on how essential workers are defined. The institute also reported about 49% of the estimated 2.4 million farmworkers in the United States were unauthorized immigrants as of 2016. And it\u2019s important those groups get vaccinated regardless of immigration status, not just as a good public health practice, but also from an ethical and humane perspective, saidDr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. \"It has obviously been a long-standing public health principle that infection anywhere affects the health of everyone,\" said Benjamin. \"It is also of the highest ethical standards to make sure everybody gets vaccinated and gets treated for infectious disease.\" Benjamin added that many unauthorized immigrants who work in essential roles are the foundation keeping society functioning during the pandemic, such as restaurant workers and caretakers. \"They\u2019re at higher risk because they\u2019re out and about and they can\u2019t shelter at home,\" said Benjamin. \"At the end of the day, if we did not vaccinate them and they could not go to work, our economy would totally collapse.\" Plus, 70% to 90% of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity in the U.S. \"As long as this doesn't happen, it doesn\u2019t matter who is vaccinated,\" said Mishori. \"To reach herd immunity in the U.S., everyone regardless of their immigration status, needs to get vaccinated.\" \"Viruses don\u2019t know the legal status of their victims,\" Mishori added. One other note is that the population in question is small compared with the total U.S. population. About 11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the U.S., making up about 3% of the total U.S. population of about 330 million. Scalise said it is Biden\u2019s policy that \"people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine.\" The Biden administration has made it clear that unauthorized immigrants are eligible to receive the vaccine if they are part of a priority group, such as health care workers or seniors. That does mean some unauthorized immigrants who meet specific vaccination criteria for job duties or age could receive a shot before American citizens who do not meet those requirements. This is in keeping with long-standing public health practices. But Scalise was misrepresenting Biden\u2019s policy when he suggested that unauthorized immigrants are being prioritized over American citizens or can jump the vaccination line. Eligibility for the vaccine is based on job and age categories \u2014 period. Under the Biden approach, immigration status is not a qualifying or disqualifying factor. His statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\u201cNew evidence ties COVID-19 creation to research funded by Fauci\"",
        "doc": "More than a year after the coronavirus first arrived in the U.S., conspiracy theories continue to spread about a virology lab in Wuhan, China, which has drawn scrutiny throughout the pandemic for research it conducted on bat viruses. One new claim about the lab comes from conservative news site WorldNetDaily, which tried to connect Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, to the origin of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. \"New evidence ties COVID-19 creation to research funded by Fauci,\" reads the headline. Despite its promise of \"new evidence,\" the WorldNetDaily article largely resembled other conspiracy theories that we have fact-checked in the past. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As evidence of its claims, the article cited an investigation by Fox News commentator Steve Hilton, who claims that the coronavirus was created at the Wuhan lab with NIH grant money. Although the NIH did fund a project at the Wuhan lab, there\u2019s no proof that the coronavirus was bioengineered. Both the WorldNetDaily article and Hilton\u2019s segment rely on a series of unsubstantiated allegations to spin a conspiracy theory about the virus being a lab creation. WorldNetDaily has since dialed back on many of its claims, issuing three separate corrections, all of which cite scientists pushing back on the notion that SARS-CoV-2 was manmade. It has also placed a question mark at the end of the original headline. However, the bulk of the article text has not been updated. In 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the part of the NIH headed by Fauci, awarded a $3.4 million grant to the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to protect people from viruses that jump from species to species. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including Thailand, Vietnam and China. The group hired the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct genetic analyses of bat coronaviruses collected in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest of Wuhan. EcoHealth Alliance paid the lab $598,500 over five years. The lab had secured approval from both the U.S. State Department and the NIH. That the NIAID funded the project is not in question. However, the WorldNetDaily article goes further than that, claiming that the grant covered \"gain of function\" research on a bat coronavirus, which \"created\" SARS-CoV-2. Gain-of-function research is a controversial form of study that involves boosting the infectivity and lethality of a pathogen. Proponents of gain-of-function say it helps researchers spot potential threats to human health and allows them to figure out ways to tackle a new virus. Fauci has advocated for gain-of-function research in the past. In a 2011 article he co-wrote for the Washington Post, he promoted it as a means to study influenza viruses. However, there\u2019s no hard proof to support the article\u2019s claims about gain-of-function research. The overwhelming consensus among public health experts is that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 evolved naturally. All parties involved in the grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology have denied that it involved gain-of-function research. \"We have not ever participated in gain-of-function research. Nor have we ever been funded to participate in gain-of-function research,\" Robert Kessler with the EcoHealth Alliance told PolitiFact last May. The NIH told us: \"The research supported under the grant to EcoHealth Alliance Inc. characterized the function of newly discovered bat spike proteins and naturally occurring pathogens and did not involve the enhancement of the pathogenicity or transmissibility of the viruses studied.\" The grant was approved in May 2014. Five months later, on Oct. 17, the Obama administration announced it would not fund new projects that involved gain-of-function research, citing safety and security risks. The NIH told us that it reviewed the EcoHealth Alliance project after the funding pause and determined that it did not involve gain-of-function research. As a result, it was not affected by the White House\u2019s new policy. Hilton and WorldNetDaily do not provide evidence that the grant covered gain-of-function research. When we reached out to Fox News, a spokesperson pointed us to the transcript of Hilton\u2019s segment. Art Moore, the author of the WorldNetDaily article, did not respond to a request for comment. MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt reviewed a paper that appears to have been published with financial assistance from the grant. According to Esvelt, certain techniques that the researchers used seemed to meet the definition of gain-of-function research. But he told PolitiFact that \"the work reported in this specific paper definitely did NOT lead to the creation of SARS-CoV-2\" because the genetic sequences of the virus studied in the paper differ from that of the new coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and the NIH have all said that the virus was not derived from a lab. If the virus had been altered in a lab, its genomic data would show signs of tampering. Although scientists from around the world have publicly shared the virus\u2019 genetic makeup thousands of times, there\u2019s still no evidence that the virus was bioengineered. On Feb. 19, 2020, public health experts signed a public statement to \"strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.\" \"Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes\" of SARS-CoV-2 \"and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,\" the statement reads, citing nine scientific studies. A detailed computational analysis of the coronavirus conducted by five researchers in March found that its genetic makeup showed no signs of alteration. The ability of the virus to bind to human cells is most likely the result of natural selection in an animal host or in humans after the virus jumped from animals. \"Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,\" the researchers wrote. There are unresolved concerns that a protective lapse at the lab could have allowed a natural virus to escape, but there is no hard proof of such a lapse. WorldNetDaily wrote that \"New evidence ties COVID-19 creation to research funded by Fauci.\" Both the NIH and EcoHealth Alliance have denied that a grant to the Wuhan lab funded gain-of-function research, though a scientist told us that one paper published with assistance from the grant seems to describe techniques similar to gain-of-function. The CDC, the WHO, and the NIH have all said that the virus that causes COVID-19 evolved naturally. There is no evidence to support that claim that it was created by researchers. This claim is False.",

        "claim": "\u201cBut we\u2019re below the national average in number of deaths in nursing homes.\u201d",
        "doc": "Gov. Andrew Cuomo continues to defend his administration\u2019s handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes following a high-profile independent investigation. Compared to the rest of the country, nursing home deaths linked to the virus are below average, Cuomo said. State Attorney General Letitia James revealed in a report on Jan. 28 that the death toll from the virus among residents of nursing homes had been undercounted in data released by the state Health Department. The report found that the Health Department had reported the overall number of COVID-19 deaths among all state residents accurately. The administration hadsaidit did not want to double count nursing home residents who died in hospitals. So their deaths in hospitals were not counted as part of the nursing home death toll. The administration has since said the numbers of people transferred from nursing homes to hospitals \"is an important data point.\" \"If you look at New York state, we have a lower percentage of deaths in nursing homes than other states,\" Cuomo said during a press briefing on Jan. 29. \"A third of all deaths in this nation are from nursing homes. New York state, we are only at about 28 percent - only. But we\u2019re below the national average in number of deaths in nursing homes.\" We approached the Cuomo administration for the source of its data. The governor\u2019s staff directed us to a statement from Dr. Howard Zucker, the state\u2019s health commissioner, from Jan. 28. In response to the attorney general\u2019s report, Zucker cited data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan source of health information. According to the Health Department, from March 1, 2020, to Jan. 19, 2021, there were 9,786 confirmed deaths of skilled nursing facility residents, including 5,957 in nursing facilities and 3,829 in hospitals. Zucker cautioned that the department\u2019s audit is ongoing, but these figures represent audited data so far. The nursing home residents who died from COVID-19 accountfor 28 percent of New York\u2019s 34,742 confirmed fatalities, which is below the national average, Zucker said. Zucker compared KFF data to CDC data to calculate that nationally 35 percent of total deaths affect nursing home residents. Across the country, KFF\u2019s tally is 146,888 long-term care fatalities, as of Jan. 22. This figure includes some nursing home staff members, as well as residents, in the areas of the country where this data is reported. The CDC reported 423,519 total deaths as of Jan. 26, 2021. Adding the number of deaths of nursing home residents who had presumed cases of COVID-19 -- 2,957 -- brings the New York percentage of nursing home deaths to 29.8 percent, still below the national average, Zucker said. We asked a senior policyanalyst with KFF about Cuomo\u2019s claim. Priya Chidambaram, who studies COVID-19 in nursing homes, told PolitiFact on Feb. 5 that Cuomo\u2019s claim is consistent with the available data. \"No matter which way you cut it, the New York share does appear to be lower than the national average,\" Chidambaram said. In October, we fact-checked Cuomo\u2019s claim that New York was \"No. 46 out of 50 states... we're 46th in terms of percentage of deaths in nursing homes,\" and found it to be Mostly False. That\u2019s because Cuomo was comparing New York to other states while not releasing data about deaths of nursing home residents in hospitals, which would have changed New York\u2019s ranking. KFF also warns that because states report data differently, \"data cannot be compared between states.\" Comparing New York to a national average \"is a more fair reading of where New York ranks,\" Chidambaram said. We also spoke with Robert Applebaum, a gerontology professor who tracks COVID-19 nursing home data at Miami University, which has a partnership with AARP. \"I would say that our data continued to show that New York state deaths are on average, per hundred, below the national average by a fair amount,\" Applebaum said. People who study the virus in nursing homes warn that data can be incomplete. States have different procedures for collecting and reporting data, such as collecting information about residents and staff, as well as the types of care facilities that are included. The Covid Tracking Project, an independent research initiative, found that as of Jan. 28, the last data release before Cuomo\u2019s statement, 157,069 long-term care residents, including assisted living facilities,and 423,645 people had died of the virus nationwide, presumed and confirmed cases. Long-term care residents represent 37 percent of total deaths in this case. In New York, 25.2 percent of total deaths involved long-term care residents, according to the Covid Tracking Project, though researchers caution that the data could represent an undercount. A week after Cuomo made his statement, the New York numbers changed significantly. The Cuomo administration released more data, through Feb. 4,about COVID-19-related deaths of people who lived in nursing homes. Presumed and confirmed virus-related deaths total 13,163, according to an analysis from the Empire Center, a conservative think tank that sued the administration for nursing home data. On Feb. 5, Cuomo announced overall deaths totaled 35,920, meaning the 36.6 percent of virus deaths were related to nursing homes. The Covid Tracking Project\u2019snational average of deaths of long-term care facility residents, as of Feb. 7, was 36 percent. KFF calculated the national average of long-term caredeaths as a percentage of total deaths at 37 percent, as of Feb. 8. At PolitiFact, we base our rulings on information available at the time the person we are fact-checking made thestatement. Cuomo said that New York\u2019s coronavirus-related death toll of nursing home residents was below the national average. Nationally, long-term care residents account for about 37percent of COVID-19 deaths, according to KFF. Data from KFF, the federal government and New York state show that New York\u2019s nursing home-related deaths, as a percentage of overall COVID-19 deaths,were below the national average at the time of Cuomo\u2019s claim. Since then, new data about the deaths of all nursing home residents, regardless of where they died, raised the percentage of nursing home residents among the state's COVID-19 fatalities. It is still slightly below the national average calculated by KFF. While his statement is accurate, there are still inconsistencies among the states in how they calculate their nursing home data, and that needs to be taken into account. So werate Cuomo\u2019s claim Mostly True. ",

        "claim": "\"Trump Won Two-Thirds of Election Lawsuits Where Merits Considered\"",
        "doc": "Donald Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits in state and federal courts seeking to challenge the results of the 2020 election. Some Trump-friendly websites make it seem like the former president prevailed in the majority of them. The Feb. 7 headline of an article from the Epoch Times, a media outlet backed by the Falun Gong religious movement, said: \"Trump Won Two-Thirds of Election Lawsuits Where Merits Considered.\" \"Of the 22 cases that have been heard by the courts and decided on their merits, Trump and Republicans have prevailed in 15,\" the site wrote. \"This means Trump has won two-thirds of the cases fully adjudicated by the courts.\" The article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Epoch Times attributed the tally to John Droz Jr., who it described as a \"physicist and environmental advocate in Morehead City, N.C.\" Droz is a political activist who has denied the science of climate change and advocated against legislation aimed at mitigating sea-level rise. None of the lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters have proved there was fraud, and judges across the political spectrum have rejected their cases. But we wanted to take a closer look at the claim that the challenges were more successful than they appear. The Epoch Times\u2019 headline gives the impression that Trump won several election-related lawsuits on their merits. But only one of the cases cited by the article was decided after Nov. 3, many were not exclusively about Trump, and some were not related to the general presidential election at all. \"No one from the Epoch Times spoke to me about their article, so they made their own conclusions,\" Droz told PolitiFact. After we reached out to the Epoch Times for a comment, the website changed its headline to read: \"In Two-Thirds of Election Lawsuits Where Merits Considered Decisions Are Favorable to Trump.\" In its article, the Epoch Times cited an analysis of \"81 lawsuits that were filed in connection with the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election.\" Droz and a team of volunteers spearheaded that work and published their findings in a public spreadsheet. It includes cases spanning from March to December 2020 and links to copies of lawsuits published by the Healthy Elections Project, an initiative from Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Between November and December, Trump and his allies lost dozens of lawsuits seeking to overturn the election results. Some cases were rejected because plaintiffs failed to prove widespread voter fraud. In a statement on his website, Droz conceded that the majority of the cases he logged have nothing to do with allegations of voter fraud. The Epoch Times also included that disclaimer in its article. \"The article (and our former and current headlines) clearly indicate that these are lawsuits related to the election, not about the election results,\" the Epoch Times\u2019 public relations team wrote in an email. \"And the article (and the Droz spreadsheet) indicate the cases involve Trump or the GOP \u2014 a lawsuit's outcome can be favorable to Trump even if he is not the plaintiff.\" In his spreadsheet, Droz found that \"Trump and/or the GOP plaintiff prevailed in 15 out of 21 cases decided on the merits\" related to the election. \"Decided on merits\" a note in the spreadsheet says, means the plaintiff \"was able to argue the facts of the case, and, if applicable, given opportunity to present evidence via discovery.\" That\u2019s more or less how the Cornell Legal Information Institute defines the term. The opposite of adjudicating cases on their merits is deciding them on procedural grounds. For example, some lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies were dismissed because they contained errors or faced jurisdictional problems. Of the 15 cases in Droz\u2019s spreadsheet, three were filed on or after Election Day. None of them involved allegations of voter fraud. And of those three, just one case, filed Nov. 4, had to do with the election results. It centered on reducing the amount of time Pennsylvania voters had to fix errors on their mail-in ballots. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee were granted an injunction against the secretary of state to prevent extending the proof of ID period by three days. The matter involved a small number of ballots that didn\u2019t change the outcome. \"Trump won one case in the post-election and lost 64,\" said Marc Elias, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm who has represented Democrats in the lawsuits. Trump has not prevailed in any cases that allege voter fraud or seek to overturn the election results. \"The key place to challenge election results is in state court election contests. Trump and his allies brought a few and lost because he did not have evidence of any error or wrongdoing in any state that could have affected the results,\" said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. \"Those cases are hard to win by design, and so Trump and his allies shifted to other suits, such as those in federal court, making legally dubious claims.\" Trump and his allies have only won one lawsuit since Election Day. But what about those filed prior to Nov. 3? We looked at each of the lawsuits that Droz noted as a victory for Trump on their merits, dating back to March 2020. Among them are cases like RNC v. Miller and Texas v. Hollins, which blocked election officials from prepopulating mail ballots with voter information and sending applications to all registered voters. Other cases are not directly about Trump or his claims about mail ballots, such as a federal court\u2019s decision to stay an injunction that delayed Arizona\u2019s voter registration deadline by 18 days. \"What we are trying to do is to identify all lawsuits related to the 2020 presidential election,\" Droz said. \"In other words, these are not all directly about Trump. For example, most of them have to do with things like whether modified state election laws were changed legally.\"But some of the cases Droz counted as wins for Trump and the GOP aren\u2019t directly related to the general presidential election. For example, Jefferson v. Dane County, filed in late March, sought to order an election official in Wisconsin to remove a Facebook post about the proper use of \"indefinitely confined\" status for voters requesting absentee ballots. Ritchie v. Polis, filed in May, had to do with whether a petition to put a measure on the ballot in Colorado had to be signed in the presence of a ballot circulator during the coronavirus pandemic. Among Droz\u2019s tally of wins for \"Trump and/or the GOP plaintiff,\" the Trump campaign was a complainant on four successful election lawsuits, two of which were filed prior to Nov. 3. Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Marymount University, said, numbers aside, the focus on cases decided on their merits paints a misleading picture of the Trump campaign\u2019s election litigation. \"The procedural dismissals aren\u2019t all small things,\" Levitt said. \"Some of them are bad lawyering. But some of them are dismissals, because Trump supporters tried to challenge laws well over a year after they were passed, well after ballots had gone out to eligible voters who had the right to rely on the fact that the ballots they were receiving were lawful, and well after the election was over.\" The Epoch Times wrote Feb. 7 that Trump won \"two-thirds of election lawsuits where merits (were) considered.\" That claim is not literally true. The Epoch Times revised its headline after we reached out. Trump and his allies have won one lawsuit related to the results of the 2020 election, and that case did not prove that widespread voter fraud affected the outcome. Judges across the political spectrum have rejected dozens of other cases filed after Nov. 3 that sought to overturn the election. Just because a case is dismissed on procedural grounds does not mean it wasn\u2019t duly considered. While the body of the Epoch Times\u2019 story contains some of that nuance, its previous headline did not. We rate it False. RELATED:Donald Trump has lost dozens of election lawsuits.

        "doc": "On Friday, Feb. 5, President Joe Biden boarded Air Force One and flew to his home state of Delaware. As images of the trip emerged, some social media users seized on the fact that Biden was taking a plane different from the one that often transported Donald Trump when he was president. \"Biden\u2019s Air Force One is not the same as Trump\u2019s Air Force One,\" reads the title of a video published Feb. 6 on Bitchute, which shows the photos of the different planes sandwiched between graphics that show the word \"LIE\" stamped across headlines declaring \"Biden Wins.\" \"Media lied to you about Joe flying on AF1,\" reads a Feb. 7 Facebook post with a similar claim. \"Notice the difference... AF1 is in the top photo complete with seal. The bottom plane is a Boeing C-40 the one Joe flew on \u2026 used for high profile government officials to fly on but NOT the President. President flies on AF1 or Marine 1. Notice the little things... and you\u2019ll catch them in their lies!\" These posts imply that Biden is not flying on Air Force One because he is not the real commander-in-chief, furthering a baseless conspiracy theory that the November election was not legitimate. This theory is not based in fact, and it rests on a flawed understanding of Air Force One. Air Force One isn\u2019t the name of a particular plane. It\u2019s the air traffic control sign designating any Air Force aircraft carrying the president. In other words, any Air Force plane carrying the president is called Air Force One. There are two types of planes typically designated for carrying the president: a Boeing VC-25A and a Boeing C-32. The VC-25A is the iconic military plane most commonly associated with Air Force One, while the C-32 is typically used for shorter domestic flights and flights to small airports that can\u2019t support the much larger VC-25A. Biden\u2019s flight from Washington, D.C. to Delaware lasted only 25 minutes, so he took the C-32 plane. Images from Feb. 5 show him disembarking from the plane at Wilmington Airport. Former President Donald Trump was frequently filmed and photographed taking the C-32 plane as well. So was President Barack Obama. Joe Biden is the president of the United States. He was duly inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20. The day\u2019s events were witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers. They were also broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS. Posts claim that \"Biden\u2019s Air Force One is not the same as Trump\u2019s Air Force One,\" which means that Biden is not the real president. Any Air Force plane transporting the president is designated with the Air Force One call sign. On a trip to Delaware, Biden took a small plane the president uses for short domestic flights and flights to small airports. Trump also took that plane when he was president. These posts are inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! RELATED: Biden took a private plane to his inauguration. He\u2019s still the legitimate president",

        "claim": "\u201cPfizer and Moderna could share their design with dozens of other pharma companies who stand ready to produce their vaccines and end the pandemic.\u201d",
        "doc": "Vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna earned praise for creating highly effective COVID-19 vaccines in record time. But are they inadvertently hurting the public by not sharing their technology with other pharmaceutical companies to help speed up vaccine manufacturing and distribution? That\u2019s what one post circulating on social media claims. \"The vaccine shortage doesn\u2019t need to exist,\" reads an image of a tweet shared thousands of times on Facebook. \"Pfizer and Moderna could share their design with dozens of other pharma companies who stand ready to produce their vaccines and end the pandemic.\" In short, the situation is not that simple. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This tweet doesn\u2019t mention that the two pharmaceutical companies are already partnering with other firms to produce the vaccine. It also makes it appear as if dozens of companies are regulated to make vaccines and have a ready supply of the raw materials, equipment and storage needed to efficiently and effectively produce them. Experts say that\u2019s not the case. When PolitiFact reached out to the tweet\u2019s author, Dr. James Hamblin, a public health policy lecturer at Yale University and writer at The Atlantic, he acknowledged that using the words \"stand ready\" in the tweet inaccurately implied the process could begin immediately. \"It takes time and investment to begin making mRNA vaccines,\" Hamblin told PolitiFact. \"The companies would need the assurance that they not lose money by getting into that space, possibly in some way similar to the assurances given during the research phase of warp speed.\" Both Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s vaccines rely on newer messenger RNA technology. (It has been studied for some time, but hasn\u2019t been used in a vaccine until now.) The mRNA is fragile and needs to be handled carefully, with specific temperatures and humidity levels to keep it from breaking down. It\u2019s highly unlikely, experts say, that \"dozens\" of manufacturing plants have the capability to get this type of production off the ground immediately. Even if Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna made their vaccine designs open source today, pharmaceutical researchers estimate that it would still take several months for other companies to produce the shots, and by then mass distribution and inoculation will be well underway. PolitiFact reached out to both companies for comment but did not hear back. Dr. Rajeev Vankayya \u2014 president of the Global Vaccine Business Unit at Takeda Pharmaceuticals and former director of vaccine delivery at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s Global Health Program \u2014 wrote a Twitter thread addressing the complexity and risk of vaccine manufacturing. Among many issues, Vanyakka said that vaccines are complex biologics and it\u2019s hard to predict whether changes to the manufacturing process will impact vaccine efficacy or safety. \"Many vaccines are made by growing viruses in cells, and when that doesn\u2019t happen as expected, it can lead to losses in production and delayed timelines. This is an area where cell- and virus-free mRNA vaccine production has a major advantage,\" Vankayya wrote. \"For these reasons, every aspect of vaccine manufacturing is tightly controlled: raw materials, equipment, production processes, training, operating procedures etc. All of it happens under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) regulations, and facilities are regularly inspected.\" THREAD: Vaccine ManufacturingBack in October, I said the Warp Speed timelines were extraordinarily optimistic given the inherent risks of vaccine development, manufacturing and distribution. All of those risks and others have materialized. 1/https://t.co/OOlGxPBnox pic.twitter.com/RwCzkljdDS According to the Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers may share any information or data about their products as they choose, as they are the owners of the information. But the firm is responsible for ensuring that any contract manufacturer is in compliance with the FDA\u2019s good manufacturing practice regulations. These rules establish minimum requirements for the methods, facilities and controls used in making and packing pharmaceuticals. They aim to ensure that a product is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. John Grabenstein, associate director for scientific communications at the Immunization Action Coalition \u2014 a vaccine information organization that works in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 told PolitiFact the tweet wrongly presumes that the companies aren\u2019t already outsourcing production. Grabenstein tracks the partnerships between pharmaceutical firms and contract manufacturers. He said that Pfizer-BioNTech is currently working with bio-pharmaceutical companies Rentschler and Polymun, while Moderna has partnered with Rovi, Recipharm and Lonza. Some of the companies are located entirely overseas, while others have plants in the U.S. Typically, the contractors are doing one of the major portions of production, Grabenstein said, such as manufacturing the bulk product, formulation of the bulk into the final preparation, filling the drug product into vials, or finishing the final packaging which could include labeling vials, inserting them and paperwork into boxes and assembling boxes for a carton. For example, Rovi, one of the companies working with Moderna, signed a contract in July 2020 to start filling and packaging 100 million doses of the vaccine in early 2021. In fewer cases, a full-fledged manufacturer is commissioned to make a mirror image of the original product, from start to finish. One example of this is the Serum Institute of India \u2014 the world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer \u2014 which is already producing a parallel version of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that the institute will market with the trade name CoviShield. The institute launched construction of new facilities back in June 2020 to make it happen. The organization recently announced a similar partnership with Novavax. \"This is incredibly intricate and the number of facilities and trained personnel is really, really small,\" Grabenstein said. \"It\u2019s not like you\u2019re just giving a recipe to another restaurant. That \u2018recipe\u2019 is thousands and thousands of pages long, and then you have to validate and show that you meet all the really tight performance specifications and prove consistency of process before any of the regulators will let you distribute any of the vaccine.\" Hamblin, the author of the Twitter post, said it\u2019s unlikely that the companies would share their vaccine designs, given the current system of intellectual property and funding, though he noted exceptions, like Sanofi. Sanofi, a French multinational pharmaceutical company, announced in January that it entered into a partnership with BioNTech, the firm that co-developed the vaccine with Pfizer. Sanofi said it will provide the firm access to its \"established infrastructure and expertise to produce over 125 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in Europe.\" Initial supplies will originate from Sanofi\u2019s production facilities in Frankfurt from summer of 2021. Hamblin noted that if vaccine makers open the intellectual property in a permanent, unconditional way \u2014 rather than on a small scale for a finite period \u2014 it could help get more companies and governments into the production \"in a more permanent, cost-effective way.\" \"If we have to manufacture boosters in specific areas for new strains, for example, or for the next coronavirus, we could be on it right away,\" Hamblin said. \"Again, speaking hypothetically about that \u2014 not implying it will happen or would be quick or easy or anything else.\" With President Joe Biden invoking the Defense Production Act, couldn\u2019t that serve to help speed things up? Yes, but it\u2019s not as sweeping as some think. The Defense Production Act of 1950 gives presidential authority to promote national defense by expediting and expanding the supply of materials and services from the U.S. industrial base. George Siber, a vaccine expert who is on the advisory board of CureVac, a German mRNA vaccine company, told Kaiser Health News that invoking the act would allow the government to commandeer an appropriate plant to expand production, but said it would still take about a year to get going. Companies would first have to undertake a thorough cleaning of their equipment and facilities to prevent cross-contamination and would need to set up, calibrate and test equipment, and train scientists and engineers to run it, Siber told KHN. \"Do you want glass? Aluminum? Filter resins? What is the thing that you need?\" Grabenstein said. \"For example, vaccine manufacturers say, \u2018if only I had more glass vials, I could increase my weekly production.\u2019 Ok, the government gets you more glass vials. Then it reveals the next bottleneck.\" He added: \"Is there production that could be stopped or delayed, and let those machines be used for this goal? Sure, but you still have to clean it, and quality control that it\u2019s really clean, and then the transfer and validation of process. It\u2019s months or years of commitment. This is not turn-on-a-dime kind of stuff.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 59 million doses of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines had been distributed and roughly 41 million administered by the second week in February. This shows that the U.S. has vaccinated 9.5% of the population, putting it about fifth in the world, according to a tracker maintained by The New York Times. A post claims the COVID-19 vaccine shortage doesn\u2019t need to exist because Pfizer and Moderna can share their vaccine designs with \"dozens\" of other pharmaceutical companies that are ready to produce the vaccines and end the pandemic. This premise oversimplifies the vaccine manufacturing process. First, the post doesn\u2019t mention that Pfizer and Moderna already have partnerships with various contract manufacturers to help speed up vaccine production. Second, industry experts say it\u2019s highly unlikely that \"dozens\" of other pharmaceutical companies that aren\u2019t already producing the vaccines stand ready to do so. Supplies, personnel training and facility compliance are just a few aspects that make the process complex and lengthy. So while such partnerships are clearly an asset to rapid vaccine production, they are not entirely practical in the grand sense that this tweet implies. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "doc": "You\u2019ve probably heard the famous proverb: Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. According to a viral Facebook post, President Joe Biden tells the adage a little differently. \"'Buy a man eat fish, he day, teach fish man, to a lifetime.' \u2014 Joe Biden,\" the Feb. 8 post says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden, who stuttered as a child, made some verbal blunders during his campaign, but social media users often deceptively edited his remarks to manufacture errors or play up the false narrative that he is senile. In this case, the jumbled quote attributed to Biden appears to be made up. PolitiFact searched Google, Nexis news archives and Factba.se, an interactive transcript website that tracks Biden\u2019s public remarks. We found no record of Biden botching the saying in such a way. If you found yourself fooled by this Facebook post, go fish. It\u2019s Pants on Fire!",

        "claim": "Says Cracker Barrel\u2019s name has racist origins and its logo depicts a whip.",
        "doc": "The Cracker Barrel restaurant chain has been serving Southern cuisine and selling rocking chairs in its old country stores since its first location opened in Lebanon, Tenn., in 1969. But several posts spreading on social media claim the company\u2019s name and logo refer to a slaveholder\u2019s whips and the barrels they were stored in. \"Cracker was a slang term for whip,\" reads one Facebook post that features an image of the company\u2019s name and logo. \"Thats why blacks called whites crackers, from the crack of the whip. A cracker barrel is a barrel that held the whips for sale at the country store. You see the whip going from the R to the K? Racism in your face!!\" The story isn\u2019t true, and the company denied the claim. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Merriam-Webster defines \"cracker-barrel\" as an adjective \"suggestive of the friendly homespun character of a country store. Dictionary.com defines the term as \"of or suggesting the simple rustic informality and directness thought to be characteristic of life in and around the country store.\" The company\u2019s name and the logo allude to barrels that were used to store soda crackers, like saltines or northern common crackers, not whips. Cracker Barrel said its logo does not depict a whip and never has. \"The part of the logo being referenced in social media posts is a flourish, which is used in the calligraphy of the logos of many brands,\" the company said in an emailed statement. \"Cracker Barrel rejects racism and discrimination in any form.\" A 2018 article by Southern Living also covered how the company got its name. The phrase, according to the article, was inspired by the barrels full of soda crackers that were for sale in general stores around the country. Visitors would sit around them to catch up on the day's news. The logo shows a man sitting in the chair, leaning on the barrel. Photographs of old newspaper ads support this. One image shared on Twitter shows a 1913 ad from Oklahoma\u2019s May Bugle featuring the crackers. Another, from the Newton Daily News in 1965, depicts the \"general store era\" of cracker barrels. The viral posts may be partly correct on the origin of the term \"cracker\" on its own as a racial slur. Jelani Cobb, a historian who has written on the etymology of some anti-white slurs, told NPR in 2013 that the word is suspected to be a shortened version of \"whip-cracker,\" and was used in the mid-18th century as an insult against poor whites who handled livestock with a whip. Cracker Barrel has faced accusations of racial discrmination in its treatment of Black employees and customers. A 2004 investigation by the U.S. Justice Department found that the chain violated civil-rights law in its treatment of Black customers at restaurants in seven states. Under a consent decree settling the case, Cracker Barrel agreed to introduce \"effective nondiscrimination policies and procedures,\" improve training and make other policy changes. Social media posts claim that Cracker Barrel\u2019s name and logo allude to a slaveholder\u2019s whip and the barrels used to store them. That isn\u2019t true. The company rejected the rumor and said its logo features a common calligraphy flourish used in the logos of many brands. The barrels referred to in the name were used at general stores to store soda crackers, not whips. We rate this False.",

        "doc": "The night before the Senate began the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, Newsmax TV host Greg Kelly falsely claimed that only one person died Jan. 6 during the U.S. Capitol riot at the center of the push to convict Trump. \"They\u2019ve been lying about so much, including, by the way, that five people died on Jan. 6, 2021,\" Kelly said Feb. 8. \"It's not true. Only one person died on that day. You know who it was? The unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt. Unarmed woman shot and killed by Capitol Police.\" Kelly was wrong about the Capitol siege\u2019s human toll. A spokesperson for Newsmax declined to comment. In addition to Babbitt, three others died Jan. 6 from medical emergencies suffered during the riot, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed. A fifth person, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, died the next day after responding to the riot. Two other officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 \u2014 D.C. police officer Jeffery Smith and Capitol Police officer Howard Liebengood \u2014 died by suicide in the weeks that followed, acting Metropolitan Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said Jan. 26 in testimony before Congress. The head of the Capitol Police officers\u2019 union said about 140 officers were injured. Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran and supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she climbed through a smashed door leading to the hallway outside the House chambers. Her death was captured on video. According to the New York Times and other news outlets, the three other Trump supporters who died during the events included 55-year-old Kevin Greeson of Alabama, who suffered a heart attack; 50-year-old Benjamin Philips of Pennsylvania, who suffered a stroke; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland of Georgia, who died as fellow rioters fought through a police line. A friend who was with Boyland told WGCL-TV she was pinned to the ground and trampled by fellow rioters, which lines up with the New York Times\u2019 reporting based on videos from the event that she \"died after losing consciousness in the crush of a pro-Trump mob.\" An incident report published by Snopes said officers dispatched to the Capitol found her collapsed and receiving CPR. Contee reported all four deaths in a press conference Jan. 6. News reports from the day, including a fact-check from PolitiFact, also said four people had died in the violence. Capitol Police announced Sicknick\u2019s death in a press release Jan. 7, writing that the officer died at roughly 9:30 p.m. that day \"due to injuries sustained while on-duty.\" Sicknick was injured while \"physically engaging with protesters\" on Jan. 6, and he collapsed after he returned to his division office, the press release said. Investigations into Sicknick\u2019s death are ongoing. Kelly said, \"It's not true (that five people died on Jan. 6). Only one person died on that day. You know who it was? The unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt.\" That\u2019s inaccurate. Four people died at the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, died the following day after he was injured in the violence. We rate Kelly\u2019s statement False. If you or people you know are thinking about suicide, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741.",

        "claim": "The COVID-19 vaccine \u201cwent out for distribution\u201d in Nebraska \u201cdays before the FDA even said they were going to approve it.\u201d",
        "doc": "In a YouTube video posted Jan. 16, and shared on Facebook, Dr. Lee Merritt, who owns a Nebraska clinic that offers tattoo removal and other services, casts doubt on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. Merritt claims in an interview segment that the vaccine was sent to states before it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \"This vaccine was rolled out to distribution centers before they even made a show of caring about the FDA approving it,\" she tells interviewer Alex Newman. \"It went out for distribution, I know in Nebraska, it was in the distribution center days before the FDA even said they were going to approve it.\" The article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked into the timeline of the FDA\u2019s approval of vaccines for emergency use, and when vaccine distribution began, and found no evidence for Merritt\u2019s claim. We reached out to Merritt twice for any evidence of her claim, but did not hear back. Merritt, an orthopaedic surgeon, has spoken out against mask mandates, and has supported the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, which was touted by President Donald Trump as a possible COVID-19 treatment, has been the subject of several fact-checks by PolitiFact, and researchers have concluded that it\u2019s not an effective treatment for COVID-19. The FDA announced on Dec. 11 that it had approved the first vaccine, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech. In Nebraska, the Department of Health and Human Services announced on Dec. 14 that the first doses of the Pfizer vaccine \"arrived in Nebraska today.\" In the same announcement, the state said that it expected to receive 4,875 doses of the Pfizer vaccine by the end of the day and 15,600 by week's end. On Dec. 21, Nebraska announced that it expected to receive the Moderna vaccine in the next week. The Moderna vaccine was approved by the FDA on Dec. 18. The communications director for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, Khalilah LeGrand, confirmed to PolitiFact that no shipments of vaccine were received before approval, nor could officials order vaccine prior to approval. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website outlines how the vaccine approval and distribution process works. \"Distribution of FDA-authorized vaccines begin 24 hours after the Emergency Use Authorization,\" the site states. \"The first deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines began December 14, 2020.\" HHS spokesman Bill Hall confirmed that no vaccines were distributed prior to FDA approval. We could find no news coverage of any vaccines arriving in Nebraska before they were approved by the FDA. Speaking at a news briefing on Dec. 12, the day after the FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, one of the federal government\u2019s top vaccine distribution planners said that vaccines were being prepared for shipment. Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said: \"As I speak today, right now, vaccines are being packaged with a lot of emphasis on quality assurance. To that end, tomorrow morning, vaccines will start rolling from manufacturing to distribution hubs.\" CNBC reported on how some of the vaccine distribution planning included sending protective gear for health care workers and inoculation supplies \u2014 but not the vaccine \u2014 to states ahead of FDA approval. These early shipments included needles, syringes and mixing vials. The advance planning also included building \"freezer farms\" to hold the vaccine, which requires cold storage. Pfizer shipped vaccines from its Kalamazoo, Mich., factory after FDA approval and from a distribution facility in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., to states. McKesson, which is distributing the Moderna vaccine, said that its shipping partners would deliver initial vaccine doses on Dec. 21, days after approval. Merritt claimed that doses of COVID-19 vaccine arrived in distribution centers in Nebraska before it was approved by the FDA. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services announced that it received both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines after the dates of FDA approval. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said that it releases vaccines for distribution 24 hours after they are approved. A top planner of the federal government\u2019s vaccine development efforts said that the vaccine began shipping after it was approved. We rate Merritt\u2019s claim False. ",

        "claim": "\u201cMore than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential infrastructure workers\u201d including \u201c41,700 DACA recipients in the healthcare industry\u201d",
        "doc": "For two decades, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has advocated for passing the Dream Act to grant legal status to certain immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. As he made his case for the 2021 version of the bill, Durbin cited the role of these immigrants as workers in essential sectors. \"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential infrastructure workers,\" Durbin said during a Feb. 4 Senate floor speech, referring to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed these immigrants to stay in the country without fear of deportation. \"That\u2019s not my term \u2014 that is the definition of the Department of Homeland Security under President Donald Trump,\" Durbin said. \"Among these essential workers are 41,700 DACA recipients in the healthcare industry: doctors, intensive care nurses, paramedics, respiratory therapists \u2014 all of them in a suspended immigration status because (the) Dream Act is still a bill, not a law.\" The number of DACA recipients who hold essential jobs during the pandemic has been a talking point for months among advocates of protecting these immigrants from deportation. A few think tanks \u2014 including one cited by Durbin \u2014 have tried to estimate their numbers, using varying criteria. Their estimates range from the tens of thousands to as many as 361,000. For two decades, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have crafted versions of legislation, sometimes called the Dream Act, that would offer a path to citizenship for immigrants who came here illegally as children. But despite bipartisan enthusiasm in Congress, the bills have stalled. In 2012, the Obama administration created DACA as an administrative program to protect these immigrants from deportation, as long as they reapplied every two years and met certain requirements. The Trump administration tried to rescind the program, but encountered legal hurdles. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden issued a memorandum directing federal officials to preserve DACA. There were about 641,000 active DACA recipients as of September. Durbin and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced the Dream Act of 2021 to allow certain immigrants to earn lawful permanent residence and eventually citizenship if they meet conditions, including passing background checks, and pursue higher education, work lawfully for at least three years, or serve in the military. Durbin\u2019s spokesperson said his statistics about essential workers came from an April 2020 report about the demographics of DACA recipients by the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization. CAP drew from a March 2020 memo by the DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency identifying essential critical infrastructure workers during the pandemic. The analysis by CAP included workers in health care, education and food-related jobs, although CISA\u2019s list also included jobs in other areas such as transportation. CAP also drew on its own analysis of Census data to estimate how many people were DACA recipients, and looked at Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational classifications to come up with its employment numbers. \"Across the country, 202,500 DACA recipients are working to protect the health and safety of Americans as the country confronts COVID-19,\" the report stated. \"They are ensuring that children are still being educated; food is still being grown, packaged, cooked, shipped, and put on the shelves of grocery stores; patients are being cared for; and much more.\" CAP found that 29,000 DACA recipients are frontline health care workers, while an additional 12,700 work in the healthcare industry as custodians, food preparers ormanagers, among other jobs. Durbin arrived at his figure of 41,700 by adding those two groups. We sent the CAP report to the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for low levels of immigration. Steve Camarota, the group\u2019s director of research, said that some of those CAP counted as health care workers are not on the frontlines of the pandemic, such as dental assistants or technologists or technicians for veterinarians or ophthalmologists. \"Honorable work to be sure, but not vital to fighting COVID,\" Camarota said. CAP said its analysis includes 6,000 health technologists or technicians, including dietetic technicians, pharmacy technicians, psychiatric technicians, surgical technologists, veterinary technologists and technicians, and ophthalmic medical technicians. But CAP\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t out of line with other groups that have come up with estimates of DACA recipients who work in essential industries: The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, concluded that there were between 72,000 and 361,000 essential workers among DACA participants in 2020. The range is based on various definitions of essential industries. The Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank devoted to studying international migration, concluded there were about 43,500 DACA recipients in health care and social assistance industries and tens of thousands in other essential industries including transportation, warehousing, retail, manufacturing and waste management. The New American Economy, a bipartisan group of mayors and business leaders that seeks an overhaul of national immigration policy, found there were 62,600 DACA-eligible individuals in healthcare. Durbin said \"More than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential infrastructure workers\" including \"41,700 DACA recipients in the healthcare industry.\" Durbin was drawing from an April 2020 report from the liberal Center for American Progress. The statistics come with some caveats, including that they are estimates and include a broad swath of workers in healthcare, including some who aren\u2019t on the front lines of treating COVID-19 patients. Even so, the numbers he cited are lower than some estimates by other groups. We rate this statement Mostly True. ",

It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The original photo appears to be an image used by some news organizations reporting on the executive orders Biden signed on his first day in office. In this version of the photo, Biden\u2019s hands appear on the desk as they do in the image being shared on social media. There is also a stack of executive orders sitting next to him and he\u2019s wearing the same blue suit and tie. Only in the original, he\u2019s also wearing a black face mask and looking up, eyes open. Video footage from that day shows the president wearing a mask, signing orders and speaking to the reporters as cameras can be heard clicking in the background. We found nothing to support the allegation that he was caught and photographed sleeping at his desk. The public schedule the Biden transition team released for Jan. 20, the day that picture was taken, began with an 8:45 a.m. church service and ended with a 9:55 p.m. appearance by Biden and the first lady on the Blue Room Balcony. The president\u2019s public scheduleis available online. While it doesn\u2019t detail his every move on a given day, it shows Biden working full days with events slated for the mornings, afternoons and evenings. We rate this image False.",

        "claim": "\u201cIf you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage.\u201d",
        "doc": "President Joe Biden\u2019s proposal for a $15-an-hour minimum wage as part of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan may not survive amid resistance in Congress, but Biden sees his campaign promise as a key path out of poverty. \"No one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage,\" he told CBS\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell in an interview that aired Super Bowl weekend. \"And if you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage.\" We found that whether a person earning below $15 an hour is living in poverty depends upon various factors, including the size of their household and the cost of living in their jurisdiction. Since 2009, the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour, though 29 states and Washington D.C. have higher minimum wages, as do some cities and counties. Among the general public, the $15 minimum wage is popular, although business groups and their allies among lawmakers argue that they would cause job losses. Economists who study wage hikes debate the impact on employment or the economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded in February that raising the federal minimum wage in annual increments to $15 per hour by June 2025 would reduce employment by 1.4 million workers but also reduce the number of people in poverty by 900,000. Measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, the current minimum wage is lower than it was from the mid-1950s to late 1980s, and in many years since then. Since Biden didn\u2019t explain during the interview whether he was referring to full-time workers of a certain household size, we asked his spokesperson to clarify what he meant. T.J. Ducklo pointed to the federal government\u2019s poverty guidelines that show a family of four earning $26,500 as living in poverty. Based on a calculation of 2,000 hours at a full-time hourly job, that means the wage earner in a family of four earning up to $13 an hour is living in poverty. If the same worker earned $15 an hour, the family would earn $30,000 a year, placing them over the poverty line. Experts on wages didn\u2019t dispute Biden\u2019s math, but said his comment doesn\u2019t fully reflect the factors that determine if someone lives in poverty. One key factor is varying housing costs depending on geographic location. Shawn Fremstad, a senior fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the federal poverty guidelines are updated based on inflation, but are otherwise outdated and based on an understanding developed decades ago of the amount of income needed to live out of poverty. \"The antiquated HHS poverty standard used by the White House includes ZERO allowance for child care, health insurance, prepared foods, meals away from home, modern transportation, and other goods and services that weren\u2019t thought of as necessities in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when a full-time housewife was assumed and mainstream living standards were very different,\" Fremstad said. Experts said that wages alone may not shed light on whether a household lives in poverty. For example, a family with two full-time workers each earning $13 an hour would be above the poverty-level, but if they need child care for two children, it would wipe out more than half their income, said Elizabeth Pancotti, policy adviser at Employ America, a group that supports a $15 minimum wage. \"As a result, it\u2019s likely unrealistic to think that all families of four earning minimum wage-level earnings could have both adults work,\" she said. \"I think it\u2019s reasonable for the White House to base their analysis on one income for a household of four.\" David Neumark, a professor of economics at the University of California-Irvine, who has found negative impacts on jobs from wage hikes, said the minimum wage is a \"crude tool to target poverty\" because it targets low wages, not low family income. \"A worker gets the higher minimum wage whether she is a single mother (who needs help!), the spouse of someone who makes $1 million a year, or the teenage daughter of that same person,\" he said. The calculation by Biden also ignores other government programs, most notably the earned income tax credit, which provides a subsidy to low-wage workers. A family earning low wages may also get food stamps, subsidized housing or Medicaid. Biden said, \"If you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage.\" A spokesman for Biden said he was referring to a family of four with one full-time income using the federal government\u2019s poverty guideline, an explanation Biden didn\u2019t include in the interview. Using that measurement, that family with a paycheck of $13 an hour would live below the poverty line. At $15 an hour, the same family would clearly be above the poverty line. So Biden was off by about a dollar, using the existing standards. But experts said wages alone don\u2019t tell the full story about whether a household lives in poverty. Other factors include child care and housing costs, for example, which can vary by geography. Generalizing a \"poverty wage\" to a specific number ignores the different circumstances that families face. Other experts said the federal definition of a poverty level is out of date and needs changing. We rate this claim Half True.

        "claim": "\u201cCongress has one job here: to count electoral votes that have in fact been cast by any state.\u201d",
        "doc": "After a lengthy string of court defeats and a formal Electoral College vote, backers of President Donald Trump have pinned their hopes on the Jan. 6 Congressional review of the vote to overturn the president\u2019s defeat. Election officials, many of them Republicans, and officials from Trump\u2019s U.S. Department of Justice have confirmed there is no proof that voter fraud affected the outcome of the 2020 election. And federal and state courts have dismissed Trump\u2019s claims of voter fraud nearly 60 times. But Trump and many allies have continued to claim without evidence that fraud influenced the election. Though a dozen U.S. senators, including Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, have pledged to object to the electoral results and seek an audit of the returns, another Wisconsin congressman says that is beyond lawmakers\u2019 power. \"Congress has one job here: to count electoral votes that have in fact been cast by any state, as designated by those authorized to do so under state law,\" U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, said in a Jan. 3, 2020, statement signed by several other members of the House. \"To take action otherwise \u2014 that is, to unconstitutionally insert Congress into the center of the presidential election process \u2014 would amount to stealing power from the people and the states.\" He\u2019s exactly right about Congress\u2019s job. Here\u2019s why. Gallagher and some other Republicans have spoken to clarify the role of Congress after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced plans \u2014 joined by Johnson and nine other Republican senators \u2014 to object to the certification of the Electoral College results. (Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri has separately promised to object to the results.) A release from the group said they are seeking an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in \"disputed states\" and intend to vote to reject electors from those states until that is complete. They said this is necessary because of \"unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.\" The effort is all but guaranteed to fail given that objections must be backed by the Republican-led Senate and Democrat-led House in order to pass. But Gallagher\u2019s assertion is that the effort is not just hopeless, it\u2019s unconstitutional. The statement noted no states have overturned their own election results, though Republicans control the Legislature in Wisconsin and other disputed states. \"There is no authority for Congress to make value judgments in the abstract regarding any state\u2019s election laws or the manner in which they have been implemented,\" the statement from Gallagher and the others said. \"The text of the Constitution is clear. States select electors. Congress does not. Accordingly, our path forward is also clear. We must respect the states\u2019 authority here. Though doing so may frustrate our immediate political objectives, we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals. We must count the electoral votes submitted by the states.\" The group\u2019s statement also noted that setting a precedent where Congress could overturn the Electoral College would delegitimize the very system Republicans have relied on for their recent success, having won the national popular vote in the presidential race only once in the last 32 years. \"I just don\u2019t think we want to endorse the principle (that) Jan. 6 is a legitimate forum for Congress to overturn the will of the states and the people,\" Gallagher said Jan. 4, 2020 on WTMJ radio. \"If you\u2019ve endorsed that principle, then you\u2019ve already destroyed the idea of American government. Right? At least you\u2019ve destroyed the conservative idea of American government.\" The process involved comes from the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, which says electors for each state should deliver their presidential and vice presidential votes to the U.S. government. That happened Dec. 14, with those votes confirming a 306 to 232 victory for former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democrat. Here\u2019s what the happens next, as spelled out in the amendment: \"The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted; -- The person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President.\" On Jan. 6, Vice President Mike Pence will open the sealed certificates from each state and hand them to tellers to read aloud. During that process he will call for objections to each state\u2019s votes. The resulting process for those objections comes from the Electoral Count Act of 1887. Objections must be made in writing by at least one member of both the House and Senate. They can be debated for a maximum of two hours before a vote, which requires a majority vote from both houses in order to pass and throw out that state\u2019s votes. Objections can fall in two possible categories: That the vote was not \"regularly given\" by an elector or that the elector was not \"lawfully certified\" according to state statutory procedures, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. But that\u2019s not to say Congress is vested with the power to substitute its preference or judgment for that of the states. In fact, federal law explicitly says the power to appoint electors belongs to the states. It says if electors are appointed by the states at least six days before the electors meet \u2014 a criteria met by all the so-called disputed states \u2014 those votes \"shall be conclusive and shall govern in the counting of the electoral votes.\" Johnson himself acknowledged this in an interview in December with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"The Electoral College met. They voted. That\u2019s our process. That process has played out,\" Johnson said when asked if he accepted Biden as president-elect. On a related note, Federal law delineates the vice president\u2019s role as simply \"to preserve order\" during that proceeding. He has no authority on his own to weigh in on whether those votes are valid, contrary to what many have claimed. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, told the Associated Press there is \"zero chance such a maneuver by Pence or the Republicans will succeed\" if they object or otherwise seek to overturn the results. The expected objections won\u2019t pass (Democrats control the House), and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had urged his party privately in mid-December not to object to the count. Gallagher said, \"Congress has one job here: to count electoral votes that have in fact been cast by any state.\" He said this in making the broader point that Congress is not tasked in this case with making \"value judgements\" about the legitimacy of those votes. That is a power left to the states. The role of Congress, as laid out in the Constitution and federal law, is effectively to observe the electors sent in by the states. And that\u2019s how the process has been carried out throughout American history. We rate this claim True.",

        "claim": "\u201cDems Pass Bill to Vaccinate Children Without Parental Knowledge, Consent.\u201d",
        "doc": "A law recently went into effect in Washington, D.C., that allows children ages 11 and older to receive certain vaccinations without parental approval if a doctor deems them capable of giving informed consent. But some posts on Facebook share a screenshot from a website called the Conservative Brief, which misleadingly displays a photo of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and features a headline that reads: \"D.C. Passes Bill to Immunize Children Without Parental Knowledge, Consent.\" The headline is repeated in text above Fauci\u2019s photo, but swaps out the word \"D.C.\" for \"Dems.\" Additional text, which comes from the article, also appears in the post and says, \"The bill not only permits children of this age (11+) to provide consent to doctors and other vaccine administrators without a parent\u2019s knowledge or consent, but also requires insurance companies, school administrators, and medical personnel to conceal from parents that\u2026\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Washington, D.C., city officials did pass and enact a law that allows minors 11 and older to get certain vaccinations without parental approval if they are deemed able to consent by a doctor. But Fauci had nothing to do with it. And more context is needed than what is presented on social media. The bill in question, \"B23-0171 - Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2019,\" was introduced in the D.C. city council on March 5, 2019 and enacted on Dec. 23, 2020. Under the legislation, children age 11 and older are permitted to receive government-recommended vaccines that their parents object to on religious grounds, if a doctor agrees. The law covers vaccines for a range of illnesses including polio, measles, mumps and rubella, as well as the COVID-19 coronavirus and human papillomavirus, which is recommended for older children. The law requires doctors who are employing the legislation send the immunization records to the child\u2019s school and seek payment directly from the insurance company, rather than involving parents. These circumstances can come into play if the parents are using a religious exemption that allows their child to attend school without being vaccinated against communicable diseases. The legislation was created in response to the country\u2019s 2019 measles outbreak, which was believed to have been fueled by parents\u2019 refusal to vaccinate their children. A representative of the D.C. chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which strongly supported the bill, said vaccination rates at the city\u2019s public schools range from 87 to 93 percent but have fallen below 85 percent at some charter schools, according to a report by the Washington Post. A famous example of a teen circumventing parental consent over vaccinations came in 2017, when Ethan Lindenberger, who has since become a public health advocate, got vaccinated against his mother\u2019s wishes when he turned 18. Some states already allow minors to get vaccinated without parental permission, but rules vary widely. There is no federal law that allows U.S. children as young as 11 to get vaccinated without parental approval. A Facebook post shares an article screenshot that features Dr. Anthony Fauci and says \"D.C. Passes Bill to Immunize Children Without Parental Knowledge, Consent.\" The city of Washington, D.C., passed a bill that allows minors 11 and older to get certain government-recommended vaccinations without their parent\u2019s consent. No such law exists at the federal level. And Fauci had nothing to do with the legislation. Also, the headline obscures that children would first have to be willing to receive the vaccination and that a doctor would have to agree they are capable of making that decision. We define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.",

No such law exists on the federal level. The bill requires doctors to send the immunization records to the child\u2019s school, rather than involving parents, if the parents are using a religious exemption that allows their child to attend school without being vaccinated against communicable diseases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose photo is featured in a story about the bill, had nothing to do with the legislation and the headline obscures that the children would first have to be willing to receive the vaccination."

        "claim": "32,000 votes for David Perdue \u201cdisappeared\u201d during the Georgia Senate runoff election.",
        "doc": "Democrats are projected to take control of the Senate after Georgia\u2019s runoff election, but on Facebook, some people are casting doubt on the vote-counting process. In a Jan. 5 post, a Facebook page called Prime Time Patriots published a clip from CNN\u2019s broadcast of election results. In a caption, the account said the video showed \"32,000 votes disappear from Georgia Senate run-off candidate David Perdue live on CNN.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) Prime Time Patriots also published the video on YouTube, where it has more than 27,000 views. We found dozens of similar claims about disappearing votes for Perdue using CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. After the 2020 presidential election, run-of-the-mill clerical errors in the vote counting process were taken out of context to spin a false narrative of voter fraud. So we wanted to take a closer look at claims that Perdue lost votes during the runoff. Those claims are wrong \u2014the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office told PolitiFact its data did not reflect a drop in votes for Perdue at any point. The tally appeared to change during CNN\u2019s broadcast because the firm that the network gets its data from corrected an error. Many news organizations don\u2019t get their vote tallies directly from the states \u2014they get them from third-party organizations. CNN receives data from Edison Research, a company that contracts with the National Election Pool, a consortium of American news organizations, to provide real-time vote results. Rob Farbman, executive vice president of Edison Research, told PolitiFact in an email that the vote drop for Perdue actually corrected a previous mistake in the vote counting process. \"The vote drop for Perdue happened after we corrected an error that had erroneously added 32,000 to Perdue\u2019s vote count in Bibb County,\" he said. \"The incorrect vote was entered by a data entry operator reporting results collected by an Edison reporter stationed at the Bibb County Office. This error was corrected within five minutes and accounts for the brief additional 32,000 votes for Perdue.\" That means that, at the time of CNN\u2019s broadcast, Perdue had 742,323 votes, not 774,723. The sudden drop adjusted for that error. We reached out to CNN for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back. The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. RELATED:How will the Senate work under a 50-50 split?",

        "claim": "An image shows National Guard at the Capitol during the Black Lives Matter protests in D.C.",
        "doc": "A social media post pairs two photos in order to highlight the stark differences in the police response to the Black Lives Matter protests and the violent insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. One of the photos shows rows of D.C. National Guard troops in riot gear stationed at the steps of a building. The second shows a few police officers in bike helmets heavily outnumbered by a mob of Trump supporters. \"Just a reminder, the 1st image was the capitol\u2019s security during a Black Lives Matter protest, the second is from today,\" reads the post. The post contains a factual error: The first photo depicting rows of National Guard troops was taken at the Lincoln Memorial, not the Capitol. ABC News Correspondent Martha Raddatz took the photo on Jun. 2, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests and posted it to Twitter. \"Your Lincoln Memorial this evening,\" reads the original caption. A similar photo posted to Getty Images possesses a caption specifying that it was taken at the Lincoln Memorial and not the Capitol. Despite this inaccuracy, the central thrust of the post has validity. There were documented differences in the waypolice handled the violent attack on the Capitol and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. After Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, police deployed harsh riot control tactics on protesters calling for justice and police brutality in Washington, D.C. and across the nation. In some cases, law enforcement officers rushed peaceful protesters with shields, sprayed them with chemical irritants, and shot them with rubber bullets. By contrast, law enforcement members were photographed and filmed displaying relative restraint during the storming of the Capitol, helping rioters down the steps and, in one instance, pausing to snap a selfie with an insurrectionist. \"The speed of the escalation of force was markedly slower (during the insurrection) than what we saw during Black Lives Matter,\" said Michael Sierra-Ar\u00e9valo, a professor at the University of Texas-Austin who studies policing. A grave exception occurred when a Capitol Police officer shot and killed a woman as she attempted to break into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby on Jan. 6. A post on Facebook seeks to compare police presence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, with police response to Black Lives Matter demonstrations in D.C. in June 2020. But it shows a picture taken in front of the Lincoln Memorial and says, \"Just a reminder, the 1st image was the capitol\u2019s security during a Black Lives Matter protest.\" That\u2019s wrong, though the central thrust of the post \u2014 that police presence on Jan. 6 was far lighter than that over the summer \u2014 has merit. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.\u200b",

        "claim": "In more than 60 cases, judges \u201clooked at the allegations that Trump was making and determined they were without any merit.\u201d",
        "doc": "A day after a mob of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, President-elect Joe Biden spoke about the importance of democratic institutions. He said that one of those pillars was the judiciary system. Trump was \"truly stunned when the judges he appointed didn't do his bidding and instead acted with integrity, following the Constitution, upholding the rule of law,\" Biden said. \"In more than 60 cases, in state after state after state, and then at the Supreme Court, judges, including people considered \u2018his judges, Trump judges,\u2019 to use his words, looked at the allegations that Trump was making and determined they were without any merit,\" Biden said Jan. 7, at an event where he introduced Judge Merrick Garland as his nominee for U.S. Attorney General. Is that accurate? Yes. More than 60 lawsuits brought by Trump and his allies failed because they were unable to prove their allegations. Some lawsuits were dismissed due to errors in the filings and other procedural issues. PolitiFact reached out to Biden\u2019s transition team and the Trump campaign but did not hear back. Marc Elias, a lawyer who has filed and defended cases on behalf of Democrats, keeps a tally on the outcome of the election cases. \"It is 63 losses by Trump and his allies,\" Elias told PolitiFact the morning of Jan. 8. \"We treat each case separately \u2014 so if there is a federal case and a state case, we treat them as two cases. We only ever count a case one time \u2014 so if there is an appeal or remand, we do not treat that as a separate loss.\" The one case where Trump found success didn\u2019t involve an allegation about fraud. The case centered on reducing the amount of time Pennsylvania voters had to fix errors on their mail-in ballots. The matter involved a small number of ballots that didn\u2019t change the outcome. News outlets, including Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, have reported that Trump and supporters of his campaign have been routinely defeated in court. \"Judges have denied or dismissed dozens of cases backed by Trump and his allies, who have pushed unsupported charges of widespread fraud in battleground states,\" said a Jan. 7 Fox News report. The lawsuits collapsed as Trump and his allies failed to prove the fraud they alleged. Plaintiffs in some lawsuits lacked standing to sue, and some were also riddled with errors. In one case, an affidavit that attempted to cite results from precincts in Michigan cited Minnesota data instead. At least 86 judges \u2014 from state courts to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 have rejected at least one post-election lawsuit filed by Trump or his supporters, according to a review of court filings by the Washington Post, published Dec. 12. Around that time, more than 50 cases had failed or been tossed out of court, the Post found. The Post analysis found that 38 judges appointed by Republicans were among the 86 judges who had rejected lawsuits. The U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-appointed justices, rejected Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s challenge to election results in four states. Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, said in dismissing one Pennsylvania challenge: \"Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.\" Biden said that in more than 60 cases, judges \"looked at the allegations that Trump was making and determined they were without any merit.\" Biden\u2019s figure is correct. Trump wasn't a plaintiff in all of them, some were his allies or supporters echoing Trump\u2019s claims. The lawsuits failed for various reasons: some had errors in the filings, others lacked standing. Mainly, the allegations lacked proof. We rate Biden\u2019s claim True.",

        "claim": "\u201cLast year, Pennsylvania elected officials passed a whole new law that allows universal mail-in balloting, and did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution said.\u201d",
        "doc": "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri led the Senate charge against the electoral college certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. Much of his argument was based on changes to mail-in voting in Pennsylvania. Hawley said that he objected to Biden\u2019s win because Pennsylvania failed to follow its own state election laws. \"You have a state constitution that has been interpreted for over a century to say that there is no mail-in balloting permitted, except for in very narrow circumstances that's also provided for in the law,\" Hawley said Jan. 6. \"And, yet, last year, Pennsylvania elected officials passed a whole new law that allows universal mail-in balloting, and did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution said.\" Hawley\u2019s central argument is that a new state law about voting by mail \u2014 passed not \"last year\" but in the fall of 2019 \u2014 conflicts with the state\u2019s constitution. The courts have not backed up his argument, and he omits the full story about the new law. The state constitution doesn\u2019t have an explicit ban on mail-in voting, and the law permitting mail-in voting passed with strong Republican support. Spokespersons for Hawley did not respond to our questions. Hawley\u2019s statement about interpretations \"for over a century\" limiting mail-in voting likely refers to limits starting in the 19th century about absentee voting for soldiers. A 1924 Pennsylvania state supreme court decision about civilians voting stated that a \"ballot cannot be sent by mail or express.\" After World War II, the state amended the constitution to allow certain limited instances of absentee voting. Article VII Section 14 of the state constitution says the state Legislature should set laws governing absentee voting in specific instances. \"The Legislature shall, by general law, provide a manner in which, and the time and place at which, qualified electors who may, on the occurrence of any election, be absent from the municipality of their residence, because their duties, occupation or business require them to be elsewhere or who, on the occurrence of any election, are unable to attend at their proper polling places because of illness or physical disability or who will not attend a polling place because of the observance of a religious holiday or who cannot vote because of election day duties, in the case of a county employee, may vote, and for the return and canvass of their votes in the election district in which they respectively reside.\" Hawley\u2019s argument is that this passage forbids a 2019 law that allowed mail-in balloting. Pennsylvania\u2019s senators disagreed. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., spoke during the debate of Biden\u2019s electoral college votes, and said the constitution gives reasons while someone might need to vote remotely, but it didn\u2019t forbid other reasons. \"There is no in-person requirement in our state constitution,\" Casey said. \"The constitution set a floor, not a ceiling, for this type of voting.\" In October 2019, the Republican-led Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an election law, Act 77, that added no-excuse voting by mail, a provision pushed by Democrats. The act says that any qualified elector who is not eligible to be an absentee elector can get a mail-in ballot. Republicans got one of their priorities included too: elimination of straight-ticket voting. The bill drew supporters from both parties, but it had more support from Republicans. \"It was always touted as a bipartisan effort to get ready for 2020, pre-pandemic, bring Pennsylvania in line with Florida and Ohio and a bunch of states that had the no excuse system,\" said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University constitutional law professor who specializes in elections. Act 77 required constitutional challenges be brought within 180 days, but that didn\u2019t happen. After Trump lost the Nov. 3 election, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and co-plaintiffs filed a case against state officials arguing that the mail-in ballot provisions in Act 77 were a violation. Kelly asked the court to prohibit the certification of results that included mail-in ballots or direct the Pennsylvania General Assembly to choose electors. One week later, the state Supreme Court dismissed the petition as untimely, writing that the plaintiffs filed their case more than a year after Act 77 was enacted and after millions of residents had already voted in the primary and general elections. The case was filed as the final ballots \"were being tallied, with the results becoming seemingly apparent,\" the court wrote. The court\u2019s three page order did not address whether Act 77 and the state constitution were in conflict. \"It is not our role to lend legitimacy to such transparent and untimely efforts to subvert the will of Pennsylvania voters,\" Justice David Wecht, a Democrat, wrote. Chief Justice Thomas Saylor, a Republican, wrote that throwing out votes at this point was extreme and untenable: \"There has been too much good-faith reliance, by the electorate, on the no-excuse mail-in voting regime created by Act 77.\" After losing, Kelly took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where an emergency application for injunctive relief was denied by Justice Samuel Alito Dec. 8. Kelly is still seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican senator, said many Pennsylvania lawmakers believe the law is constitutional. \"Clearly the state legislature and governor believe it is consistent with the state constitution,\" Toomey said. \"This law wasn\u2019t challenged when it was passed, it wasn\u2019t challenged when it was applied during the June primary election. It was only challenged after President Trump lost the general election.\" Election law experts said that even if Hawley were right about the law violating the state constitution, which is debatable, it still wouldn\u2019t be the role of the U.S. Congress to fix it. When Hawley defended his decision to challenge Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral vote, University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck tweeted: \"In other words, @HawleyMO\u2019s main gripe is that the (Republican-led) Pennsylvania legislature violated the *Pennsylvania* Constitution when it expanded mail-in voting in 2019. 1. That\u2019s not fraud. 2. That\u2019s a question for the *Pennsylvania* Supreme Court to decide \u2014 and it passed.\" Vladeck told us in an email that it is factually correct that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has never ruled on whether Act 77 is consistent with the Pennsylvania Constitution \u2014 the court threw out the challenge as untimely. But to suggest that it\u2019s Congress\u2019s role to intervene in the question of state constitutionality is wrong. \"Indeed, it would completely upend fundamental constitutional principles if Congress, rather than the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, were the last word on the meaning of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and yet that\u2019s what Hawley\u2019s arguing for here,\" he said. Hawley said, \"Last year, Pennsylvania elected officials passed a whole new law that allows universal mail-in balloting, and did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution said.\" To suggest that lawmakers passed a law that plainly violated the state constitution is wrong. The point Hawley raised is debatable, not clear cut. Additionally, Pennsylvania lawmakers cared enough about constitutionality to give a window of time \u2014 180 days \u2014 for people to challenge the law\u2019s constitutionality. No one did until Trump lost the election there. Finally, it\u2019s important context to note that election experts said that what Hawley argued for \u2014 congressional intervention \u2014 was the wrong remedy for a question about the state constitution.

        "claim": "\"This election actually was not unusually close.\"",
        "doc": "In a speech before what he called \"the most important vote I've ever cast,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., rejected challenges to the validity of Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 presidential race. \"The Constitution gives us here in Congress a limited role,\" McConnell said on Jan. 6, shortly before the Capitol was breached by mobs of President Donald Trump supporters. \"We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids. The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken. They've all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever.\" McConnell went on to say that \"this election actually was not unusually close. Just in recent history, 1976, 2000, and 2004 were all closer than this one. The Electoral College margin is almost identical to what it was in 2016. If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.\" Was McConnell correct that the 2020 election \"was not unusually close\"? The final data provides strong support for McConnell\u2019s assertion. Here\u2019s a rundown of the evidence. Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory was exactly the same as Trump\u2019s in 2016: Both won states with a collective 306 electoral votes. Four years ago, Trump declared this number of electoral votes to be \"a massive landslide.\" We rated that False, noting that 306 electoral votes ranks no better than the bottom quarter of Electoral College showings in American history, and no better than the bottom one-third of the showings since the end of World War II. Experts say the more restrained characterization by former President Barack Obama \u2014 that Biden\u2019s victory was \"decisive\" \u2014 is well-supported. Biden\u2019s electoral vote total, like Trump\u2019s, \"was on the low side,\" said John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. \"The big difference, of course, is that Trump lost the popular vote. Biden is winning a majority of the popular vote, and by a healthy margin.\" Biden\u2019s 306 electoral votes rank higher than either victory by George W. Bush, who accumulated only 271 in 2000 and 286 in 2004. It would also be slightly larger than the number won by Jimmy Carter in 1976, Richard Nixon in 1968, and John F. Kennedy in 1960. Biden\u2019s achievement is especially notable since it occurred during a period known for high partisan polarization. \"The era of landslide elections appears to be behind us,\" said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist. \"The strengthening of partisanship in the electorate has dampened the magnitude of swings from one party to the other.\" An even stronger sign of the decisiveness of Biden\u2019s victory was the popular vote. The popular vote doesn\u2019t determine the presidential victor \u2014 otherwise we would have had President Al Gore and President Hillary Clinton \u2014 but comparing the margin of Biden\u2019s popular-vote victory with that of his predecessors suggests how broad-based his support was this year. When all ballots were counted, Biden led the popular vote tally by almost 7.06 million votes, according to the Cook Political Report's 2020 National Popular Vote Tracker. This means Biden amassed a wider popular vote margin than any candidate since 1996 except for Obama in 2008, who won by more than 9.5 million votes. Biden\u2019s popular-vote win was wider than the reelection victories of George W. Bush and Obama. It\u2019s also wider than the popular-vote victories of Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, both of whom lost the electoral vote. And it's wider than Bill Clinton amassed in his first victory in 1992. Meanwhile, it was far wider than John F. Kennedy in 1960, Richard Nixon in 1968, and Jimmy Carter in 1976, and it was only about 18,000 votes shy of George H.W. Bush\u2019s winning margin in 1988, when Bush won a whopping 426 electoral votes. Arguably an even more impressive measure of Biden\u2019s win is his percentage of the popular vote. Biden, running as the candidate of the out-of-power party, secured 51.3% of the popular vote. Going back to 1932, Biden\u2019s percentage of the vote for the out-of-power party was exceeded only by the 55% won by Dwight Eisenhower, the Republican running to succeed Democrat Harry Truman in 1952, and the nearly 53% by Obama, who was running to succeed Republican George W. Bush in 2008. In fact, you have to go back to 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt ousted President Herbert Hoover amid the Great Depression, to find a higher percentage of the vote for a candidate taking on an incumbent. We looked at the collective margins for the seven closest states in the four close elections in recent history: 2000, 2004, 2016 and 2020. Collectively, the margins for these seven states in 2020 were 284,597 \u2014 wider than any of the other three elections. The seven closest states we looked at for 2020 were, in descending order, Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, New Hampshire, Maine, and North Carolina. (We excluded non-competitive states such as Delaware and Wyoming.) In the end, the highly competitive states of Pennsylvania and Michigan didn\u2019t even make the list of seven closest states. The 2000 election remains the benchmark for a close election. The seven closest states that year \u2014 Florida, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Iowa, Oregon, New Hampshire and Nevada \u2014 collectively had just a 46,000-vote margin. By contrast, the seven closest states in 2020 currently have a collective margin more than six times wider than the closest seven in 2000. The one metric that shows a relatively close race is the number of added votes in various states that could have tipped Trump into victory in those states and, in turn, could have gotten him to 270 electoral votes. Trump could have won the Electoral College, narrowly, if he\u2019d secured an additional 10,457 votes in Arizona (with 11 electoral votes), another 11,779 votes in Georgia (16 electoral votes), 20,682 more votes in Wisconsin (10 electoral votes), and 22,641 added votes in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd congressional district (which allocates one electoral vote on its own). Together, that\u2019s fewer than 66,000 votes that, if perfectly allocated among those states, would have flipped the election to Trump. This amounts to .04% of all votes cast. McConnell said, \"This election actually was not unusually close.\" By most metrics \u2014 including electoral votes, the popular vote margin, the percentage of the vote he won, and the margins in the seven closest states \u2014 Biden did put up impressive numbers compared with recent presidential winners. The sole notable sign of a close race was that, due to the vagaries of the electoral college, only about 66,000 more votes for Trump \u2014 if they were perfectly allocated among the right states \u2014 would have flipped the election from Biden to Trump. But that dynamic has been the case in other recent presidential elections. We rate the statement True.",

        "claim": "Says left-wing activist John Sullivan \u201cincited (the) insurgence of (the) US Capitol.\u201d",
        "doc": "UPDATE, Jan. 15, 2021: Following the publication of this fact-check, John Sullivan was arrested Jan. 14 in Utah, the U.S. Justice Department announced. He was charged in a criminal complaint with one felony count of interfering with law enforcement in connection with a civil disorder, as well as misdemeanor charges of unlawful entry and disorderly conduct. An affidavit from an FBI agent that was filed in support of the criminal complaint and arrest warrant noted that despite Sullivan\u2019s claims that he was present as a journalist, he has no press credentials and is not affiliated with any journalistic organization. The affidavit does not say Sullivan led the mob. Social media users and allies of President Donald Trump have continued pushing the baseless claim that it was antifa activists, not Trump supporters, who mobbed the U.S. Capitol. There\u2019s no evidence that the crowd was infiltrated or led by antifa activists in disguise, and specific individuals held up online as antifa activists have turned out to be Trump supporters.One man accused of being an \"antifa thug,\" for example, is actually a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Another man labeled as an antifa activist is really a known neo-Nazi. But claims faulting antifa for the violence at the Capitol keep coming. The latest target is Utah\u2019s John Sullivan, the founder of Insurgence USA, an activist group against police brutality. \"Anti-Trump founder of radical left-wing group \u2018Insurgence USA\u2019 John Sullivan incited insurgence of U.S. Capitol,\" said the text over one image shared widely on Facebook. The post originated on Parler, a social media platform targeted to conservatives. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Other posts sought to link him to antifa. Sullivan has not been shy about his presence at the Capitol riot. He filmed the events as they happened, and he was nearby when Capitol police fatally shot a woman inside the building. He described the shootingduring an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that night. Sullivan confirmed to PolitiFact that he entered the building with the rioters, and that he is in the photographs shown as part of the Facebook post. But there\u2019s no proof that he \"incited (the) insurgence,\" and he has denied any affiliation with antifa, a broad coalition of anti-fascist activists. In a Sept. 8 press briefing, FBI Assistant Director Steven D\u2019Antuono said the agency has \"no indication\" that antifa played a role. In interviews with PolitiFact and other national and local news outlets, Sullivan said he went to the riot to document what happened, not to participate. On his two Twitter accounts, Sullivan shared videos he captured as the crowd stormed into the Capitol, including a nearly 40-minute YouTube video that graphically documents Ashli Babbitt\u2019s fatal shooting by police. \"I was not leading that in any shape, form or fashion,\" Sullivan said of the mob that bashed through windows and doors and stormed the Capitol. \"I didn\u2019t organize it. I had no part in planning it. I was only there to experience and witness what went down.\" Jade Sacker, a documentary filmmaker working on a project about Sullivan and his brother, was there alongside Sullivan for much of the riot. As she filmed Sullivan and the mob around him, he was in her sight \"40 to 50% of the time,\" Sacker told PolitiFact. \"I wouldn\u2019t say that he was directing the charge or anything. He was certainly actively there and interested in what was going on,\" Sacker said. \"He was recording the whole time.\" PolitiFact reviewed Sullivan\u2019s video of the mob into the Capitol and Babbitt\u2019s shooting. It doesn\u2019t show Sullivan clearly engaged in the violence or leading the run up to the Capitol, although it does show him animated as he spoke with police and rioters from the frontlines. At points in the video, Sullivan can be heard telling others he was only filming and discouraging violence. At other points, he appeared to encourage what was happening. As rioters scaled a wall outside, for example, he cheered them on. \"We did this s---, together,\" he said after the barricades came down. \"This is f------ history. We\u2019re all a part of this f------ history.\" \"Let\u2019s burn this s--- down,\" Sullivan can be heard saying on the video before heading inside. It was not clear if the comment was directed to or heard by any specific person or people. He told Deseret News he was trying to blend in. In other videos online, he can be seen filming. \"He was vocal, but I wouldn\u2019t say he was inciting violence,\" Sacker said. Sullivan spoke with police and FBI agents Jan. 7 about the shooting he witnessed, he said. \"You could say if I were going to be arrested, they would\u2019ve done so,\" he said. Investigations by law enforcement agencies are ongoing, with several arrests made among the thousands of Trump supporters who took part in the chaotic scene. But there\u2019s no evidence that Sullivan \"incited (the) insurgence\" on his own, as the Facebook post suggests. Social media users have linked Sullivan to antifa and Black Lives Matter because of his past protest history and social media activity. His Twitter accounts have frequently used #antifa, #blm, and other anti-Trump or anti-police hashtags, PolitiFact found. The cover photo for one of his accounts advertised a Jan. 6 Insurgence USA event to \"Kick These Fascists Out of DC.\" Sullivan has also been filmed using incendiary language in the past. At a small August rally in Washington, D.C., he described the need to \"rip\" Trump out of office, according to Fox News. Photos highlighted on his personal website show him holding a firearm. But Sullivan said he\u2019s not a part of the antifa coalition often blamed for violent events, noting that Trump supporters at the riot were shouting \"f--- antifa.\" Sacker said she has followed Sullivan for four months and accompanied him to many protests, including some affiliated with Black Lives Matter. He is not pro-Trump, she said, but he cares about \"dismantling the system.\" She said she had not personally seen him be violent. Sullivan faces criminal charges related to a June 29 protest in Provo, Utah, according to public records. Deseret News reported that he helped organize the event and was seen on recordings kicking and threatening drivers while directing protesters to block intersections. PolitiFact found no other criminal history. Those claiming antifa infiltrated or led the mob at the Capitol have provided no proof. The evidence of Trump supporters participating, however, is indisputable. The march to the Capitol was weeks in the making, with plans indicating the potential for violence drawn up in the open on social media forums and pro-Trump websites. Video and photographs from the scene show Trump-branded paraphernalia and flags. A Facebook post claimed Sullivan \"incited (the) insurgence of (the) US Capitol.\" Sullivan joined the mob of Trump supporters that entered the Capitol, filming the events as they transpired and posting his videos online. But he was one person among thousands. There\u2019s no evidence that he \"incited\" the violence himself or led the charge into the Capitol. Sullivan denied any affiliation with antifa, although he has posted related hashtags on Twitter. We rate this statement Mostly False. PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report. UPDATE, Jan. 11, 2021: This fact-check was updated to include more detailfrom Sullivan\u2019svideoat the Capitol. Our ruling remains the same.",

        "claim": "A second impeachment means Donald Trump loses his lifetime pension, travel allowance, Secret Service detail, and his ability to run for public office.",
        "doc": "House Democrats have filed an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump for \"willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States\" after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 that temporarily stopped Congress from counting electoral college ballots. With only nine days until Inauguration Day, the Democrats\u2019 move to impeach Trump is unlikely to result in his removal from office. But a viral social media post says it could have lasting effects on his future in public life. The post, published by the liberal Facebook page The Other 98% on Jan. 9, outlined four potential consequences for Trump if the House votes to impeach him for a second time: \"For those wondering if it\u2019s worth impeaching him this time, it means he: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Celebrities like comedian Jim Gaffigan and advocacy organizations like the March for Science have shared the post to millions of followers. (Screenshot from Facebook) The source of the screenshot in the posts is a Jan. 8 tweet from Ben Costiloe, a 57-year-old man who lives in Texas. He told PolitiFact that he copied the text from something he saw on Facebook. \"I looked at it, and they didn\u2019t have any followers,\" said Costiloe, whose own Twitter following has grown more than tenfold since publishing the post. \"I thought about it and said, \u2018Well, this isn\u2019t completely true, but it could be true in a perfect world.\u2019 So I threw it out there.\" But Costiloe\u2019s viral tweet paints a misleading picture of what could happen if Trump is impeached again. If the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump, he would not automatically lose his post-presidency perks \u2014two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate would have to vote to convict and remove Trump. Trump could lose his ability to run for office after he leaves the White House, but it would not happen solely as a result of impeachment. The Constitution says, \"Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\" Most of the benefits afforded presidents were passed as part of the Former Presidents Act. Two benefits mentioned in Costiloe\u2019s tweet \u2014an annual lifetime pension of about $200,000 and annual travel allowance of up to $1 million \u2014 are enumerated in the law, which passed in 1958. The law says those benefits apply to presidents \"whose service in such office shall have terminated other than by removal pursuant to section 4 of article II of the Constitution of the United States of America.\" That section of the Constitution spells out the process by which a president may be removed from office \"on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" \"Impeaching him does nothing; only convicting him would,\" said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University. \"And under current law (the Former Presidents Act), convicting him only strips him of those benefits if he is convicted while still in office (which looks certain not to happen).\" Meanwhile, a 1962 law provides Secret Service protection for former presidents, at their request, \"for a reasonable period after he leaves office.\" \"The FPA provides some limited security and travel expenses to former presidents and their spouses, but only if they aren't using the Secret Service protection that is provided under the other separate law,\" said Demian Brady, director of research for the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. \"So the FPA's benefits specifically limit its benefits in the case of impeachment and removal, but the other law that provides Secret Service protection does not. A separate law would be required to (do) that.\" Congress could pass a new law to strip Trump of his post-presidency benefits, and it would not require the same two-thirds vote that a conviction in the Senate would. But impeachment alone \u2014even the second in Trump\u2019s one-term presidency \u2014wouldn\u2019t disqualify Trump from receiving some benefits. On the last point of Costiloe\u2019s tweet, Kalt said Trump could lose his ability to run for office again \"even after he has left office,\" if the Senate votes to convict him. The Senate has never convicted an impeached president, much less a former president. However, Michael J. Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, wrote in a post for the Just Security law forum that, \"if an impeachment begins when an individual is in office, the process may surely continue after they resign or otherwise depart.\" \"Understandably, members of Congress and the American people might lose the appetite for subjecting a president to impeachment once he has left office for good,\" he wrote. \"But that is a political choice not a constitutional directive.\" If the Senate did vote to convict Trump, the Constitution doesn\u2019t specify how many votes are required to also disqualify him from holding public office. In the past, the Senate has used a simple majority vote to bar three people, all federal judges, from holding office. A Facebook post says that if Trump is impeached again, he will lose his lifetime pension, travel allowance, Secret Service detail, and his ability to run for public office. That claim misses the mark on most counts. If the House votes to impeach Trump, the Senate would have to convict him while he\u2019s still in office in order to revoke his lifetime pension and travel allowance. With only days until Biden takes over the White House, that prospect is unlikely, and Trump\u2019s Secret Service detail would remain unaffected. After Trump leaves the White House, the Senate could bar him from holding public office. Congress could also change the law to deny Trump his benefits. But neither would happen simply as the result of impeachment. The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Reynolds spokesperson Pat Garrett pointed toIowa Workforce Development datato back up the claim and a check shows that\u2019s true, though other indicators exist to show when an economy is prospering. In January 2020, Iowa\u2019s employed workforce totaled 1,704,900 people, aMarch 16, 2020,Iowa Workforce Development report shows. That\u2019s 600 more people than in the previous month and 33,000 more people than in January 2019. No other month in Iowa\u2019s recorded employment has been higher than that January 2020 figure. By November 2020, the number of employed Iowans totaled 1,561,600, about 143,000 less than 10 months prior. The total available civilian labor force declined by93,000 since April 2020. Ryan West, deputy director of the Iowa Workforce Development toldThe Daily Iowanin a phone interview that between October 2019 and February 2020, more than 1.7 million Iowans were employed, the most since the data first became available beginning in 1976. The numbers used, he said, are sourced from monthlyreportsfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the past two years, Iowa has had historically low unemployment rates for the state. According to the Iowa Workforce Development, nine of the past two decades\u2019 lowest reported monthly unemployment rates were recorded in the last two years. The lowest unemployment rate over the past 20 years was 1.9 percent in October 2018. But were wages going up? The annual mean wage from May 2019, the last availabledatafrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was $47,330, up from the May 2018 average wage of $46,150. According to a2019 State of Working Iowareport by the Iowa Policy Project, which since has merged with another organization and has been renamed Common Good Iowa, the median hourly wage went up about 80 cents since 2009 to $18.40, most of which came in the last two years. However, that wage growth has been \"slow to come\" according to the report. Iowa\u2019s top 10 percent of earners had the highest share of wage growth. Before COVID-19, the numbers show Iowa\u2019s employed workforce was the largest in the state\u2019s history. But the numbers have declined since the pandemic. We rate the governor\u2019s statement as True.",

        "claim": "Summer \u201cprotesters outside the White House were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, a full militarized response. While ... rioters were able to breach the Capitol.\u201d",
        "doc": "In remarks to Ohio reporters, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said there was a big difference in police response between what Black Lives Matter protesters faced and what riotous Trump supporters encountered at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. In the summer, \"peaceful Black protesters outside the White House were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, a full militarized response,\" Brown said Jan. 8. \"While this week, white supremacists, rioters were able to breach the Capitol.\" The ease with which a mob of people fresh from a rally led by President Donald Trump breached the Capitol and ran rampant through the halls of Congress has led to resignations and triggered formal investigations. While no two protest situations unfold in exactly the same way, Brown\u2019s comparison of the earliest clashes in each event is accurate. After Minneapolis police killed unarmed George Floyd on May 25, protests against police brutality spread across the country. In Minneapolis, protesters surrounded a police station May 28, entered it and set fires inside. There was looting, vandalism and other fires in the city. Trump vowed the federal government was ready to step in. \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen,\" Trump tweeted at about 1 a.m. May 29. \"Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" RELATED: From Miami '67 to Donald Trump 2020: The history of 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts' On the afternoon of May 29, the Black Lives Matter protest movement arrived in Washington, D.C. About 1,000 people gathered in a park across the street from the White House. The confrontation between police and protesters grew more tense. At about 3 a.m., a line of officers in riot gear with shields advanced and deployed chemical irritants to disperse the crowd. The next day, police in full riot gear, again facing a line of protestors \u2014 some throwing water bottles and eggs \u2014 charged and broke up the group. Video from a local news reporter captured the clash. Insanity outside the White House. Three warnings of an unlawful assembly from the Secret Service before storming into the crowd. A lot of people have been hit with paper spray. In all the chaos, at least one person was tossed to the ground and presumably arrested. pic.twitter.com/Ab2eSkq9CS There are iconic images that took place after the initial clashes. Police on horseback and officers firing pepper balls charged through peaceful protesters. Their goal \u2014move them away from a church where Trump was scheduled to have his picture taken holding up a Bible. Lines of National Guard troops stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. But even from the first encounters, the use of riot gear and shields against Black Lives Matter protesters stands in sharp contrast to the security line that met the Trump supporters at the Capitol Jan. 6. When marchers walked up to a portable metal barricade on the Capitol grounds, they saw a handful of officers in their regular uniforms standing on the other side. The marchers and officers struggled over control of the barricade. The Trump supporters overwhelmed the police. The moment it all began. pic.twitter.com/gdyx9Udgc6 Soon after, a line of police were tussling with Trump supporters on the steps of the Capitol. Rioters shoved police officers, spraying chemical irritants and hitting them with lead pipes. Police deployed flash bangs and pepper spray in an attempt to ward off the crowd. A couple of hours after rioters breached the Capitol\u2019s first line of defense, police reinforcements began to arrive. Many wore riot gear. They used tear gas to disperse the rioters. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 6 p.m. curfew. After curfew, law enforcement officers clad in body armor began to use aggressive tactics similar to their treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters, advancing on rioters and whacking them with batons. While police forces prepared for the worst with the Black Lives Matter protests, the people in charge of protecting the Capitol failed to anticipate the aggression of the Trump supporters. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, head of the House committee that controls the Capitol Police budget, said that a week before the march, the Capitol Police assured him that everything was under control. Ryan said he was told they expected a \"pretty vanilla\" protest. \"There wasn't going to be any kind of violence anticipated,\" Ryan said. \"Maybe some dust-ups. Maybe issues around people trying to get guns into the District of Columbia, where they have very strict gun laws, but absolutely nothing like this.\" The people who study crowds and police say there was ample reason to plan for a much more aggressive group. \"There was clear intelligence about where this was headed,\" said Ed Maguire, Arizona State University criminologist. \"All you had to do is go on Parler (the alt-right social media platform) for 10 minutes. I was on the night before. They were talking about violence. This is open source material, and the police would have had more.\" Just a month earlier, a Dec. 12 Trump rally had attracted members of the Proud Boys, a violence-prone group that showed up again on Jan. 6. In December, they were involved in street fights that led to multiple stabbings. Bowser urged residents to stay home and avoid any confrontation with people coming to the rally. The night before the assault on the Capitol, members of the Proud Boys and a militia group called the Three Percenters were in Washington wearing body armor and helmets, with some carrying clubs. Brown said Black Lives Matter protesters outside the White House faced a more militarized response than rioters who assaulted the Capitol. The record shows that early on, federal officials planned for aggressive clashes with Black Lives Matter protesters, while those responsible for Capitol security planned for peaceful protests. Full riot gear was quickly used during the summer, but was not at key spots in the police line set up around the Capitol. There were ample warnings that Trump supporters would engage in physical violence, but officials did not plan accordingly. We rate this claim True.",

Trump's term ended today (at 7:39PM ET),\" reads one Facebook post. It includes a screengrab of a State Department webpage that reads \"Donald J. Trump's term ended on 2021-01-11 19:39:00.\" The image is legitimate, but the claim in the post is misleading. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here\u2019s what happened: Nine days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, Trump\u2019s biography page on the official State Department website was edited to read what we see in the post, that \"Donald J. Trump's term ended on 2021-01-11.\" Mike Pence\u2019s biography was also updated to say, \"Michael R. Pence's term ended on 2021-01-11.\" But these changes did not amount to an official \"statement\" from the State Department, as the claim suggests. Citing two unnamed diplomats, Buzzfeed News reported Jan. 11 that the website edits were the work of a \"disgruntled employee.\" CNN confirmed Buzzfeed\u2019s report. Both web pages were taken down around 3:50 p.m. Jan. 11 and replaced with error messages. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ordered an internal investigation, according to Buzzfeed. The website changes appeared as Democrats were beginning the impeachment process against Trump on grounds that he incited a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol. The State Department did not return requests for comment. The claim that the State Department released a statement that Trump\u2019s term ended Jan. 11 contains an element of truth in thatthe agency\u2019s website was edited to falsely suggest it had. But the change was not an official statement by the State Department. Rather, reporting indicates this was the action of a rogue employee; Trump is still president. We rate it Mostly False.\u200b",

        "claim": "The second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d",
        "doc": "How bipartisan was the second impeachment of Donald Trump? CNN anchor Jake Tapper said it was the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in history. Trump\u2019s second impeachment was \"not just bipartisan \u2014 it\u2019s the most bipartisan impeachment in American history,\" Tapper said moments after the vote was taken on Jan. 13, 2021. While the second House impeachment of President Donald Trump was largely approved on party lines, it did attract a higher level of bipartisan support compared with past presidential impeachment efforts. Ten House Republicans sided with Democrats in voting to impeach Trump. That\u2019s more than the number of Republicans who supported the first impeachment of Trump in 2019, which was zero. It\u2019s also higher than the five Democrats who voted to impeach President Bill Clinton on both successful counts in 1998. And it was more bipartisan than the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, which did not receive any Democratic support. (We\u2019ll address President Richard Nixon, who resigned under threat of impeachment, as well.) The article of impeachment considered by the House on Jan. 13 cited Trump\u2019s false claims about the election results, including at the rally of his supporters on Jan. 6. By having \"incited\" the crowd, the article said, Trump \"gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of government.\" The final vote was 232 to 197, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting for the sole article of impeachment. The Republicans who broke ranks and voted to impeach were Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican; John Katko of New York; Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; Fred Upton and Peter Meijer of Michigan; Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse of Washington; Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio; Tom Rice of South Carolina; and David Valadao of California. Here\u2019s a rundown of past presidential impeachments, including some committee votes. When Johnson was impeached in 1868, no Democrat in the House supported the overall floor vote to impeach. In that vote, all but two Republicans voted for impeachment. The House went on to pass 11 specific articles of impeachment, along largely party-line votes. The impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 attracted less bipartisan support for the two of the four articles approved by the Judiciary Committee that went on to win approval on the House floor. The first article that won approval from the full House was Article 1, which said that Clinton had \"willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony\" to the grand jury related to the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky sexual harassment cases.\" This article passed the committee on a party-line vote. On the floor, the article was approved 228-206, with five Republicans voting against it and five Democrats voting for the article. The other one to pass the House, Article 3, said that Clinton had obstructed justice related to the lawsuits against him. This article also passed the committee on a party-line vote, and it passed the full House by a 221-212 margin, with 12 Republicans voting against it and five Democrats voting for the article. Two articles passed the committee but failed on the floor. Article 2 involved perjury during Clinton\u2019s answers in depositions. In committee, this was a party-line vote, except for one Republican defection \u2014 then-Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. On the floor, it failed, 205-229. And Article 4, which addressed obstruction of Congress, passed the committee on a party-line vote before failing on the floor, 148-245. Article 1 against Trump in 2019 addressed abuse of power, focusing on Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to strong-arm Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden. The article passed the Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote. Article 2 focused on Trump\u2019s efforts to block cooperation with Congress on its impeachment inquiry. This passed the Judiciary Committee by an identical party-line vote. On the House floor, no Republican voted for either article. Two Democrats voted against Article 1, Reps. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey. (Van Drew later switched his affiliation to the GOP.) Peterson and Van Drew were joined in voting against Article 2 by Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine. The impeachment of President Richard Nixon in 1974 didn\u2019t make it to the House floor because Nixon resigned first. So it\u2019s not directly comparable. But we can look at what happened in the House Judiciary Committee when it approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon. Article 1, which focused on obstruction of justice, won support from six Republican committee members as well as all Democrats. That was about one-third of Republicans on the committee. Article 2, which focused on abuse of power, also secured the support of six Republican committee members in addition to all Democrats. Article 3, which focused on obstruction of Congress, received less bipartisan support, even though it passed the committee. This article saw two Democratic defections and only two Republicans joining with the Democratic majority. Such votes make Nixon\u2019s impeachment the previous high-water mark for bipartisanship, though again it\u2019s not a case of apples-to-apples since we\u2019ll never know what the floor vote would have looked like. That said, the number of committee Republicans joining Democrats for the Nixon impeachment was smaller than the number of overall House Republicans backing Trump\u2019s second impeachment. Tapper said the second impeachment of Donald Trump was \"the most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\" Trump\u2019s second impeachment attracted more Republican support \u2014 10 GOP floor votes in favor \u2014 than the impeachments of Andrew Johnson or Bill Clinton, or Trump\u2019s first impeachment.

        "claim": "\u201cThere were several states where outside actors dramatically changed the rules of the road, so to speak, two weeks out, one week out, on how elections would be run.\u201d",
        "doc": "Rep. Chris Jacobs, a Republican who represents suburbs around Buffalo and Rochester, said in a statement that he voted against certifying the electoral college vote because of election irregularities, and said states made changes to election processes that sowed distrust. In an interview with WKBW, he told reporter Hannah Buehler: \"There\u2019s been a lot of questions about election integrity, but I was going in terms of my constitutional role,\" he said. \"When you look at the Constitution of the United States, it gives specific power to state legislators to control, run and dictate the terms of elections in their states. There were several stateswhereoutside actors dramatically changed the rules of the road, so to speak, two weeks out, one week out, on how elections would be run.\" We wondered about whether \"outside actors\" changed election procedures one or two weeks before the election. Competitive states We reached out to Jacobs\u2019 spokesperson, who said that the \"outside actors\" Jacobs referred to are courts and officials outside of state legislatures. Spokesman Christian Chase referred us the U.S. Constitution, which states, in Article 1, Section 4: \"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.\" Jacobs was referring to situations in Pennsylvania and Arizona, Chase said. In Pennsylvania, the State Supreme Court extended by three days a deadline that had required ballots to be received when the polls closed, Chase said. This happened Sept. 17. Mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania had begun to be delivered in some counties in late September, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. He also said the Pennsylvania Secretary of State \"waived a requirement in state law\" that required signature verification on mail-in ballots. This guidance was issued on Sept. 11, and was upheld by the state Supreme Court, which found that the guidance was not in conflict with state law. Jacobs\u2019 spokesman also said that Pennsylvania \"allowed for unequal curing of ballots by different jurisdictions.\" Factcheck.org found that there were inconsistencies when it came to curing ballots, or the process of allowing voters to correct mistakes so their ballots will be counted. Some counties did, and some did not. While the guidance from the state, which was issued close to the election, was uniform, it was applied inconsistently, the site found. In Pennsylvania, the secretary of state is the state\u2019s \"chief election official,\" and is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. In Arizona, Jacobs pointed to changes to the registration deadline by federal courts. We asked election and voting experts about procedures in swing states. The laws that were in place for the general election were in place for months, often years before the election, said David Becker, executive director and founder of The Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonprofit organization that promotes election security and increased voter participation. In states where lawsuits were brought --Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin --the changes were made by legislatures dominated by Republicans, Becker said. The rules were set in advance, but there was some pre-election litigation, and voters had to rely upon whatever the final rules were, Becker said. ABC News published a story less than a week before Election Day regarding state election officials who had to deal with the impact of last-minute litigation and the resulting court rulings. County election officials in Michigan and Wisconsin told the network that differing directives from courts had been confusing. The U.S. Supreme Court also issued rulings affecting election procedures in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in the days before Election Day. In Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19, a little more than two weeks before Election Day, the court allowed a three-day extension to count ballots to remain in place. Amber McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonpartisan organization that promotes voting by mail, told PolitiFact that secretaries of state are responsible for providing guidance and direction to local election officials, so it\u2019s natural for them to provide guidance, especially in emergency situations. States have different ways of administering elections, and legislatures can formalize these policies in statute, according to The National Conference of State Legislatures. \"State legislatures, with input from their governors, can make state laws about the administration of elections and make or initiate election administration amendments to their state constitutions,\" according to a 2019 Congressional Research Service report. \"State laws and constitutions can also delegate or defer responsibility for decisions about the administration of elections to other state or local officials and to voters.\" Jacobs said that he voted against certifying the Electoral College vote because he looked at the Constitution and it gives state legislatures authority over elections, but that he saw that \"outside actors dramatically changed the rules of the road\" within two weeks of the election. State laws regarding election procedures were in place months, or years, before Election Day. There were some legal challenges and guidance from state election officials near the election. But secretaries of state and other state and local election officials have duties related to running elections and are not \"outside actors.\" Courts are the place to hear legal challenges to election rules. It's questionable that three-day registration deadline extensions, extending the deadline for ballots to be received,and offering voters opportunities to correct their ballots are \"dramatic\" changes to election procedures, as Jacobs states. We rate this claim Mostly False. ",

        "claim": "Says Rep. Pramila Jayapal was not wearing a mask in Congress during the U.S. Capitol mob.",
        "doc": "Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., blamed her Republican colleagues after she and two other House Democrats tested positive for COVID-19 in the days following the U.S. Capitol mob, which forced lawmakers into close quarters as they took shelter from the violence. \"I just received a positive COVID-19 test result after being locked down in a secured room at the Capitol where several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask but recklessly mocked colleagues and staff who offered them one,\" Jayapal wrote in a Jan. 12 tweet. Several Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has supported the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, were seen on video refusing to wear masks while members of both chambers waited out the siege from the secured room. But some social media users say photo and video evidence shows that Jayapal also didn\u2019t wear a mask as the rioters breached the building and halted congressional proceedings. \"There\u2019s pictures and videos of (Jayapal) not wearing a mask that day,\" says one tweet reposted on Jan. 12 to Facebook, which shows an image of Jayapal from the day of the riot. Posts sharing the same photograph on Facebook and other platforms were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image \u2014 a screenshot from a longer video taken as the mob moved inside the Capitol \u2014 purports to show Jayapal maskless in the balcony of the House chambers. But the image is missing context. Jayapal said in a subsequent tweet and later in a Jan. 13 interview on ABC\u2019s \"The View\" that she had taken off her face mask to put on a gas mask. \"We were then under siege,\" Jayapal said, explaining that she was trapped in the gallery with about 12 other lawmakers. \"The Capitol police told us at that point to get off of our chairs, to get on the floor, to take off our masks, and to actually be ready to put on our gas masks. So if you look at those pictures, I am holding in my right hand a gas mask.\" \"We were specifically told to take off our masks, because you can\u2019t breathe within the gas mask if you have the other mask on,\" she continued. \"So all of us had been wearing masks. We took off our masks. We held our gas masks. And we were down on the floor.\" The full video footage from which the photograph was captured supports Jayapal\u2019s explanation. As Snopes reported, the video shows Jayapal with her gas mask in hand. The video shows another person, seated on the floor a row above Jayapal, with the gas mask already on. \"You can see the gas mask in her right hand in the photo,\" said Jayapal spokesperson Chris Evans. Evans said Jayapal tested negative for COVID-19 on Jan. 5, a day before the Capitol siege. Jayapal criticized Republicans for refusing masks while lawmakers were \"locked down in a secured room at the Capitol.\" The out-of-context photograph shows Jayapal in the House chambers, before she had been ushered to that secured location. A Facebook post says a video screenshot shows that Jayapal was not wearing a mask in Congress during the Capitol mob. The post is missing critical context: Jayapal and other lawmakers taking shelter in the balcony of the House chambers were instructed to take off their masks and prepare to put on gas masks.

        "claim": "\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"",
        "doc": "Votes from the November election have now been counted, recounted, reviewed by state and local officials and used to nominate electors \u2014 which in turn were counted, then confirmed by Congress Jan. 6. This process confirmed Democrat Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election. Along the way we\u2019ve seen hundreds (if not thousands) of fact checks and dozens of court decisions explaining why the stolen election narrative fails to hold water once claims are examined closely. Nevertheless, the baseless fraud claims put forth by President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have persisted and remain accepted among a large slice of American conservatives. Prominent among these is the idea of ballot \"dumps\" \u2014 where the late reporting of largely Democratic totals in several states are seen as suspicious or proof of malfeasance. But the new Republican leader of the Wisconsin state Senate says that\u2019s nonsense. Talking about the need to restore voters\u2019 confidence, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said Wisconsin needs to allow work on absentee ballots to begin before Election Day. Wisconsin is one of just a handful of states that ban election workers from starting to process these ballots until then. \"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee,\" LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said Jan. 10, 2021, on WKOW-TV\u2019s Capitol City Sunday. \"It just takes them that long to load in those absentee ballots. So we need to make sure there\u2019s a process in place going forward so that reporting is timely.\" LeMahieu added that there was not \"widespread\" voter fraud in the 2020 election. The state senator is precisely right about why Milwaukee ballots were reported in the early morning hours of Nov. 4, as the Wisconsin tally neared its conclusion. (Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes, one of five he flipped from Trump). Let\u2019s review what we know. The \"ballot dump\" claim has been one of the most widespread since the November election. A conservative website trumpeted it as \"Voter Fraud in Wisconsin.\" Widely shared Facebook posts claimed there was a \"ballot dump\" or \"found\" votes. Trump himself asserted that his lead in key states \"started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted\" and that \"Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly.\" This line of thinking also appeared in numerous lawsuits and one nonsensical claim that statistics show the probability of Trump losing in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania \"given President Trump\u2019s early lead ... is less than one in a quadrillion\" in each state. Those claims led to unanimous debunking from an array of fact-checking organizations. All are built on a fundamental misunderstanding of the vote-counting process. Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states that don\u2019t allow absentee votes to be counted before Election Day. So the unprecedented volume of absentee ballots spurred by the pandemic created a bottleneck in the largest cities. That brings us to a simple logical chain that explains the late Democratic votes in Milwaukee (and Atlanta and Detroit and Philadelphia). Milwaukee, like most large cities, is a longtime Democratic stronghold. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the city of Milwaukee 77% to 18%. We knew well before the election that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to vote absentee. Polling showed 81% of the people planning to vote absentee in Wisconsin supported Biden. We knew it was going to take a long time to count the absentee ballots, leading them to be reported later. That counting time is why LeMahieu said he wants to change the law to allow workers to start on absentee ballots before Election Day. \"We need clear laws that are easy to follow, and we must instill confidence in the electorate that the results are accurate and free of fraud,\" LeMahieu said told PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"With the proper safeguards in places to ensure transparency, allowing the ballot count to begin early should accomplish both of those goals.\" LeMahieu said the Milwaukee \"ballot dumping\" is due to the amount of time it took to count absentee ballots. He\u2019s right We\u2019ve seen an array of nonsensical claims that these ballots were illegitimately added based on the progress of the Wisconsin count. But those all overlook the simple truth that these ballots were reported later because it took longer to count them. We rate LeMahieu\u2019s claim True. ",

        "claim": "\u201cCoronavirus vaccinations seem to be causing 50 times the adverse events of flu vaccinations after just the first of two shots.\u201d",
        "doc": "An article widely shared on Facebook from the website of Ron Paul, a Texas doctor and former GOP congressman, carried this ominous headline: \"Coronavirus vaccinations seem to be causing 50 times the adverse events of flu vaccinations after just the first of two shots.\" The article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article, which appeared Jan. 6 on the website of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, cites a journalist\u2019s reporting of data from a federal reporting system that health officials use to track and study \"adverse events\" associated with vaccines, ranging from mild side effects to serious health problems. The journalist, Alex Berenson, told PolitiFact he has not reported that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing the adverse events, only that the data are showing many more such events than are reported with flu shots. \"I am pointing to a potential problem that this data raises,\" he said. Health experts told us there isn\u2019t enough data in the reporting system to indicate whether a vaccine causes a particular reaction, or to accurately compare the adverse events associated with different vaccines. The article reported on what it called \"disturbing numbers\" from a series of tweets a day earlier from Berenson. Berenson wrote that through Dec. 22, with fewer than 1 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine given, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had received reports of 307 emergency room visits and 17 \"life threatening\" events, for \"roughly 50 times the rate of adverse events from the flu vaccine.\" \"It gets worse,\" the article said, noting that Berenson wrote that the COVID-19 adverse events were reported after shots were given mostly to healthy people in settings where problems can be quickly treated and before the rollout to older, less healthy people. Berenson\u2019s tweets said he obtained his figures from the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The CDC told us its system does not allow for searches dating back to Dec. 22, so we could not replicate the searches Berenson did, and Berenson told us he didn\u2019t have the earlier search results from the CDC\u2019s database. But Berenson showed us screenshots of results from a more recent search he did of the database, which he said showed that adjusted for the number of vaccinations given, there were now roughly 35 times as many adverse events reported for COVID-19 vaccinations as for flu shots. The search results he showed us indicated 4,060 adverse events after 4 million COVID-19 vaccinations in the three weeks ended Dec. 31; and 9,553 adverse events reported over 18 months for 180 million flu shots given during the 2019-20 flu season. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a physician in the infectious-disease division at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned against reading too much into the CDC\u2019s figures cited in the tweets or the article. \"The VAERS system is very noisy, so it's hard to compare,\" he said. The system, he said, identifies \"a lot of temporal associations that are not necessarily causal.\" VAERS is not designed to indicate whether a vaccine caused a health problem, but is good for detecting patterns of events that might indicate a problem, which in turn might trigger further investigation of a possible safety concern. The site notes that it contains \"unverified reports\" of adverse events that occur after vaccination. Anyone can make a report. Results of searches on the VAERS database appear with this caveat, among others: \"VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.\" As part of heightened safety monitoring for COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration \"have strongly engaged healthcare providers, public health jurisdictions and the public to report adverse events to VAERS,\" said CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund. Dr. Werner Bischoff, professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, said he had \"several concerns\" with the statement comparing the COVID-19 and flu vaccines. \"Any adverse events, from mild to severe, are much more closely monitored\" for COVID-19, given that people receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are observed for at least 15 minutes, which generally does not occur with flu vaccinations, Bischoff said. \"The range of side effects is broad, as with any other vaccine, and we need more data to accurately estimate the occurrence of severe reactions caused by the COVID vaccine,\" he added. \"Making comparisons at this early stage may lead to misinterpretation,\" he said. The Ron Paul Institute did not respond to our requests for further information. An article shared in Facebook posts claimed: \"Coronavirus vaccinations seem to be causing 50 times the adverse events of flu vaccinations after just the first of two shots.\" A journalist\u2019s search of raw data from the CDC\u2019s reporting system indicated that the rate of reported \"adverse events\" following COVID-19 vaccinations is many times higher than for the flu shots. The journalist who surfaced the data that the article drew from said he wasn\u2019t drawing any conclusions about cause and effect. The CDC and experts say the raw data from the reporting system cannot be used to draw conclusions about whether vaccinations cause the adverse events. Experts say the data about the new COVID-19 vaccinations are too new to make meaningful comparisons to flu shots. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Says that \u201cthe way to reach \u2018herd immunity\u2019 is for >70% of the population to get vaccinated.\u201d",
        "doc": "The strategy to achieve herd immunity within a population to reverse the spread of COVID-19 has been a matter of intense debate over the course of the pandemic. One component of this debate involves the herd immunity threshold, or the percentage of a populationthat must be immunized from a disease, be it through infections or vaccinations,for the spread toabate.The moreinfectious acontagion, the higheritsthreshold. For instance, measles, a highlyinfectiousdiseasethat is at least three times as contagious as COVID-19,requires a herd immunity threshold level of around 94%, meaning that 94% of a population will need to be immune to measles beforeits transmission rate declines. Butpinning down aconcreteherd immunity threshold levelfor COVID-19has so far beentheoreticalguesswork.Researchers at Johns Hopkins Universitysay that the herd immunity thresholdfor any viruslies between50% and 90%.Researchers in the United Kingdomand Brazilhypothesizedduring the early part of the pandemicthat thresholdcouldbe as low as6% to 21%, althoughtheirstudyhas since beenfound to have critical errors. Earlier this month, state Rep. Jon Rosenthal, D-Cypress,who has lost a family member and friend to COVID-19, took to Twitter to dispel common myths and \"rampant misinformation\" about the virus and its vaccines, which arenow slowly being distributedthroughout Texas.In his tweet thread, Rosenthalechoeda number that has commonly beenrepeatedas COVID-19's herd immunity threshold. \"To defeat this pandemic AND recover our economy, the safest and most effective way is for the population to be immunized,\" he tweetedTuesday.\"The way to reach \u2018herd immunity\u2019 is for >70% of the population to get vaccinated.\" Immunity can be reached one of two ways: through natural infections, which create antibodies in people who have recovered from a disease that can potentially ward off future infection(an estimated 20% of the global population has been infected naturally); or through vaccination, a safer way to immunity because it does not cause illness. The herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 has been somewhat of a moving target throughout the pandemic as researchersgrapple with understanding the virus. Let\u2019sreview what current thinking is on the virus\u2019threshold. There are two ways healthexpertsthink about a virus\u2019 infection rate, mathematically represented as theRvalue. First, there\u2019s the more theoretical R valueknown asthe basic reproduction number, orR0(pronounced\"R naught\").This term indicates the average number of times one infected person will transmit the virusto another person. For example, measles has an R0value between 12 and 18, meaning that one person infected with measles will, on average, spread the virus to another 12 to 18 peoplebefore they either die or recover.R0is a theoretical figure that assumes everyone in a population iswithout immunity andsusceptible to infection. Then there is the more practicalversion of the R value\u2014 theeffective reproduction rate, represented as Rt. The effective reproduction rateconsiders the fact that somepeoplewithin a populationwill be immuneto adisease, or that certain interventions have been put in placeto slow spread, like social distancing or mask-wearing.The Rtvalue ismore of a real-time representation of what a virus\u2019 infection rate isanditdecreases as a greater share of the population is immunized or as more interventions are put in place. The exact R value for COVID-19, however,has not beenconcretelydetermined. According to Spencer Fox, associate director of the COVID-19 modeling consortium at the University of Texas,data during the early period of the pandemicsuggested that theR0rate was 2.5. Now it is believed to be within the 4 to 6 range.The Rtvalue, while much harder to determine, is estimated to be around 1.05 in the U.S. thanksto preventative measures and natural immunities. \"There's kind of been this shifting conversation about what is the actual basic reproduction number of the virus,\" Fox said. \"We try andextrapolate from other populations, but every population will have a slightly different number.\" Typically, it is the R0figure that is used in determining a virus\u2019 herd immunity thresholdbecause the goal is to return to a state of normalcy where interventions are no longer necessary.The threshold is calculated by plugging the R0value into a formula: [1-(1\u00f7R0)]*100 =threshold%. With an R0valueof 2.5, the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 would be 60%. With an R0value of6, the threshold would be 83%. But according to Dr. David Dowdy, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, these numbers are highly theoretical. The herd immunity threshold is \"something that\u2019s easy for the public to understand, but not really reflective of reality,\" Dowdy said. \"The reality is that it\u2019s a spectrum, but people like tosee things in black and white and they like to have specific numbers to latch onto.\" \"At some point we will build up enough immunity.Whether it be through people getting the disease or through people getting the vaccine,that transmission(rate)will start to go down,\" he said. \"It's not like there's a magic number that we have to hit and if we don't hit it we'll forever have this pandemic with us. The more people we can get vaccinated the fewer people get sick and die.\" According to Fox, publicizing a herd immunity threshold level, while not accurately reflective ofreality, does have usefulness. \"Right now, the main use of providing a high number is to motivate people to actually get the vaccine, because in my mind we should try and vaccinate as many people as possible,\" Fox said. The 70% threshold cited by Rosenthal and others is, to Fox, \"in the ballpark.\" \"It could be possibly as low as 50% and as high as 80%, so 70% is kind of in the middle. I would shoot higher. I wouldn't have this expectation that the disease goes away at this point,\" he said. On Jan. 5, Rosenthal published a tweet saying that the way to reach herd immunity is for at least 70% of the populationto get vaccinated.In an email, Rosenthal said his informationcame from a Reuters article that citedtheEuropean Center for DiseasePreventionand Controlestimating a67%herd immunity thresholdand the WorldHealthOrganizationestimatinga65% to 70%threshold. \"There are apparently too many unknowns to be certain, but the 70% figure lines up with some common estimates,\" Rosenthal said. The herd immunity threshold is calculated by using a disease\u2019s rate of transmission. Although scientists have not agreed upon a definite rate, and even though these rates are highly theoretical,estimates show that the thresholds lies somewhere between 60% and 83%. We rate this claimMostly True.",

        "claim": "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d",
        "doc": "When the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued its latest job numbers, the Jan. 8, 2021, release brought a jaw-dropping number to light \u2013 from November to December the U.S. economy lost 140,000 jobs. Then came another jaw-dropper: As a group, only women lost jobs. Then came this claim, from Wisconsin Treasurer Sarah Godlewski. On Jan. 9, 2021, she tweeted a link to a CNN article about the job losses among women with this comment: \"This headline is hiding something from you. It wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs, it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment. Any response we have to this pandemic and economy has to also address structural inequality.\" Did Black and Latina women carry the brunt of job loss nationally, while white women gained employment? When asked for a source, Godlewski\u2019s office pointed to the CNN article, dated Jan. 8, that she retweeted. That article noted the U.S. economy lost 140,000 jobs overall, with women losing 156,000 jobs, while men gained 16,000 jobs. Her office also pointed to this paragraph in the article: Black and Latina women disproportionately work in some of the hardest-hit sectors in the pandemic, often in roles that lack paid sick leave and the ability to work from home. As schools and day cares closed, many were forced to make hard trade-offs between work and parenting. \"Those sectors are less likely to have flexibility, so when employers are inflexible or women can't come to work because of caregiving responsibilities \u2014 they have to exit the workforce,\" said Nicole C. Mason, president and CEO of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. We did our own check of the BLS numbers, and the preliminary November and December numbers reflect what was in the CNN article. But Godlewski\u2019s claim was specifically on the difference in outcomes for Black and Latina women, as groups, when compared to white women. The BLS conducted a separate survey known as the Current Population Survey, which measures employment for Black, Hispanic or Latina, and white women ages 20 and older. This data was part of the Jan. 8 release of the December jobs numbers. Participating households respond to the survey in the week of Dec. 6. That data, which is not seasonally adjusted, indicates the number of employed Black women decreased by 82,000 from November to December, and the number of Hispanic or Latina women employed decreased by 31,000. Meanwhile, the number of employed white women increased by 106,000 in the same time span. The overall number of women in the labor force has been fluctuating since the March-to-April numbers, which marked the first full hit of the pandemic. There was a decrease from July to September. Laura Dresser, an economist with the Center on Wisconsin Strategy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said prior economic declines were led by male-dominated fields, such as construction and manufacturing. The pandemic-driven decline, she said, has strongly affectedareas \u2013 such as the restaurant and education industries \u2013 with a high number of women workers. \"And those jobs are low-wage jobs,\" Dresser said. \"They're held disproportionately by women. They're held disproportionately by people of color.\" With a link to a news article, Godlewski claimed: \"It wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs, it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\" Federal statistics show that, as a group, women accounted for all of the job loss from November to December. What\u2019s more, the number of employed white women increased during that time frame, while the numbers for Black and Hispanic or Latina women fell. We rate this claim True. ",

        "claim": "Says a photo shows armed soldiers protecting Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration.",
        "doc": "D.C. National Guard troops stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial over the summer observing people protesting the killing of George Floyd. Now, an image from that time is being shared on Facebook suggesting it shows soldiers protecting the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. \"If you need 10,000 armed soldiers to protect you\u2019re (sic) inauguration from the people, then you probably weren\u2019t elected by the people,\" said text over the image of a row of National Guard troops standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The Jan. 15 post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) About 20,000 National Guard troops are expected in D.C. for Biden\u2019s inauguration, but the image shared on Facebook is not from this month\u2019s security preparations. It was taken June 2, 2020 and showed troops at the Lincoln Memorial and matches an image credited to ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz. Raddatz posted a similar photo on Twitter that day as well as a video on her Instagram account that showed the scene. A similar photo was taken by a Getty Images photographer that day with the caption, \"Members of the D.C. National Guard stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as demonstrators participate in a peaceful protest against police brutality and the death of George Floyd, on June 2, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" The protest was among many that took place across the country as demonstrators called for racial justice and end to excessive use of force by police after Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer. The Facebook post also ignores the context of the heightened security for Biden\u2019s inauguration \u2014 on Jan. 6 a mob of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, some armed, stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers gathered to certify Biden\u2019s electoral win. FBI Director Christopher Wray on Jan. 14 said law enforcement was \"seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter\u2026 about a number of events surrounding the inauguration.\" \"We\u2019re concerned about the potential for violence at multiple protests and rallies planned here in D.C. and at state Capitol buildings around the country in the days to come that could bring armed individuals within close proximity to government buildings and officials,\" Wray said during the Jan. 14 briefing on inauguration security. Biden beat Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Biden got more than 7 million votes than did Trump, and also won the Electoral College votes 306-232. Election officials and courts have rejected Trump\u2019s false and baseless claims about widespread election fraud and irregularities. A Facebook post suggests that a photo shows armed soldiers protecting Biden\u2019s inauguration. Thousands of troops are expected in D.C. to protect Biden\u2019s inauguration; an increase in security is due to threats of potential violence, especially after a mob rioted the Capitol earlier this month. But the photo shared on Facebook shows National Guard troops at the Lincoln Memorial in June, during protests for racial justice. We rate the post Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\u201cCNN-NPR photojournalist Jade Sacker was embedded with antifa leader\" during the U.S. Capitol attack.",
        "doc": "A conservative website claimed that a CNN and NPR journalist joined an anti-fascist leader in inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The headline of the Gateway Pundit article stated: \"CNN-NPR Photo-Journalist Jade Sacker was Embedded with Antifa Leader John Sullivan During Siege of US Capitol The article, widely shared on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The text of the article refers to Sacker as a CNN photojournalist and later says, \"Sacker has done work for NPR, CNN, NBC and other liberal outlets.\" CNN and NPR denied Sacker was working for them during the Capitol attack, and CNN said she has never worked for the network. Sacker said she was there with Sullivan as part of a documentary she is producing about him and his brother James, who is described as a conservative activist. Sacker told the Associated Press her film \"intends to portray the emotional interior of the family\u2019s story as they become divided\" by the brothers\u2019 \"opposing political activism.\" There is no evidence Sacker was at the Capitol working for a news organizationworking for a news organization covering the siege. Sullivan has denied having any connection with a broad coalition of left-wing activists known as antifa, and there is no evidence that antifa activists incited the attack. However, Sullivan was arrested in connection with the attack.Sacker not working for a news organizationfor a news organization at the Capitol Both CNN and NPR said Sacker was not working for them at the Capitol. CNN spokesman Matt Dornic said: \"Jade Sacker was not at the Capitol on our behalf. She does not work for CNN in any capacity and has never been employed by our organization.\" NPR spokeswoman Isabel Lara said: \"NPR retained Jade Sacker in October of 2020 for a freelance photography assignment. She has not performed any services for NPR since. She was not at the Capitol at our request or on our behalf. If we determine that her actions in any way contributed to the incident at the Capitol, Ms. Sacker will not be engaged by NPR again.\" Sacker, who says she is a documentary photographer, lists NPR and CNBC among her clients. She told PolitiFact for a previous fact-check that she is a documentary filmmaker working on a project about Sullivan and his brother, and was alongside Sullivan for much of the riot. She did not return a call for this fact-check. Sullivan is a Utah resident and the founder of Insurgence USA, an activist group against police brutality, who joined supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol. He has denied any affiliation with antifa, although he has posted related hashtags on his Twitter accounts. There remains no legitimate evidence that the mob at the Capitol was infiltrated or led by antifa activists in disguise. We rated as Mostly False a claim shared on Facebook that Sullivan incited the riot at the Capitol. incited the riot at the Capitol. On Jan. 15, Sullivan was arrested in connection with the Capitol attack. He was charged with one felony count of interfering with law enforcement in connection with a civil disorder, as well as misdemeanor charges of unlawful entry and disorderly conduct. An affidavit from an FBI agent filed in support of the criminal complaint and arrest warrant noted that, despite Sullivan\u2019s claims that he was present as a journalist, he has no press credentials and is not affiliated with any journalistic organization. The affidavit does not say Sullivan led the mob or had a special role organizing it. An article widely shared on Facebook claimed that \"CNN-NPR photojournalist Jade Sacker was embedded with antifa leader\" during the U.S. Capitol attack. Sacker is a freelance photojournalist. CNN said she has never worked for the network. NPR said she once took photos for its network. Both said she was not working for them during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Sacker was with Utah activist John Sullivan inside the Capitol during the attack. She said she was there to work on a documentary about him. Sullivan has denied being connected with antifa and there is no evidence that antifa incited the attack. He was arrested in connection with being inside the U.S. Capitol nine days after the attack. We rate the statement Mostly False. Note: On Jan. 18, 2021, after this article was published, Sacker confirmed that she was not working on Jan. 6 for CNN or NPR and that she was accompanying Sullivan at the Capitol as part of her documentary on him.",

        "claim": "The COVID-19 vaccine is dangerous because 23 people died in Norway \"within hours\u201d of receiving it.",
        "doc": "As countries around the world begin COVID-19 inoculations, vaccine critics are promoting the notion that the shots can easily cause injury or death \u2014 even though the evidence does not support their claims. That\u2019s what happened after Norway reported the deaths of elderly people who had received the COVID-19 vaccine. Social media posts, like this one from Fox News commentator Jan Morgan, point to the Norwaydeaths as evidence that the vaccine causes harm: \"23 die within hours of taking COVID vaccine. ... I\u2019ve never taken a flu shot and I\u2019m certainly NOT letting anyone inject this garbage in to my body.\" Morgan\u2019s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Initial Norwegian reports on Jan. 15 indicated that 23 people had died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. By Jan. 18, the number of deaths had increased to 33, out of about 48,000 vaccinated. Though the Facebook post says people died \"within hours\" of receiving the vaccine, Norwegian authorities said only that 23 deaths occurred within six days of vaccination, and published reports do not indicate the time frame for the remaining 10 deaths. The Norwegian government said the country\u2019s vaccination program is initially targeting the most vulnerable \u2014 the elderly and those in nursing homes \u2014 and \"a high proportion\" of the latter were very frail or terminally ill and already very near the end of their lives. As a result, health authorities said, \"It is expected that deaths close to the time of vaccination may occur.\" There\u2019s no proof that the COVID-19 vaccines caused the deaths, the Norwegian Medicines Agency said. Norway\u2019s strong \"reporting culture\" for vaccine adverse reactions means that \"health care professionals have a low threshold for reporting possible adverse reactions, even when the causal relationships appear very unclear,\" a government report said. An average of 45 people die each day in Norwegian nursing homes and similar institutions, according to the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Therefore, \"it is not a given that this represents any excess mortality or that there is a causal connection,\" Camilla Stoltenberg, head of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said at a press conference on Jan. 18. The COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly but rely on scientific research that is decades old, and they underwent a rigorous review process, PolitiFact has reported. That hasn\u2019t prevented a barrage of misinformation about them, including claims that they can cause death and infertility and that they are part of a plan to implant people with microchips \u2014 claims that have all been debunked by PolitiFact. U.S. health experts were aware of the possibility that deaths following vaccination would be perceived as being caused by the vaccine. Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a member of the U.S. federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said in December that the likelihood of nursing home patients dying from other causes shortly after vaccination could erode public confidence in the safety of the vaccines. She said that\u2019s why she voted against prioritizing residents of long-term care facilities for vaccines. However, residents and staff of long-term care facilities in the U.S. are among the most vulnerable when it comes to COVID-19. They represent 40% of COVID-19 deaths nationwide, though they make up less than 1% of the U.S. population. Other members of the advisory committee voted to include nursing home residents in the earliest phase. Of the 33 Norwegians who died after receiving the vaccine, 13 of their cases have been completely assessed by health authorities. The 13 people were all older than 80, with some older than 90, and were considered severely frail, which was defined as having serious heart failure, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and similar conditions. As of Jan. 18, Norway had vaccinated more than 48,000 people, the majority of whom were nursing home residents. The 33 fatalities represent fewer than 1 out of 1,000 of those who were vaccinated, Steinar Madsen, the medical director of Norwegian Medicines Agency, told Bloomberg. For some of the frailest patients, though, \"the possibility that relatively mild side effects of the vaccine could have serious consequences cannot be ruled out,\" health officials said. Common vaccine reactions \u2014 including fever, nausea and diarrhea \u2014 could have contributed to some of the deaths in the 13 cases for which investigations have been completed. \"There is a possibility that these common adverse reactions, that are not dangerous in fitter, younger patients and are not unusual with vaccines, may aggravate underlying disease in the elderly,\" Madsen told the medical journal BMJ. \"We are not alarmed or worried about this, because these are very rare occurrences and they occurred in very frail patients with very serious disease.\" The risks of the COVID-19 vaccine for much older people are not as well understood, because a limited number of people 85 and older participated in the large clinical trials. Madsen said Norwegian officials are now recommending careful medical evaluation of the very frail before deciding whether vaccination is appropriate. A Facebook post says, \"23 people diewithin hours of taking the COVID vaccine. ... I\u2019ve never taken a flu shot and I\u2019m certainly NOT letting anyone inject this garbage in to my body.\" The claim implies the deaths were caused by the vaccine. Norway health officials said 33 elderly people died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. (The initial figure of 23 was later updated.) But the vaccine has not been proved to be the cause of death, and those who died were very frail nursing home residents with serious underlying illnesses. The Facebook post says people died \"within hours\" of getting the vaccine, but authorities said only that 23 deaths occurred within six days of vaccination, and published reports do not indicate when the other 10 deaths occurred. An average of 45 people die each day in Norwegian nursing homes and similar institutions, so it is not clear that the deaths represent any excess mortality or a connection to the vaccine. Because it lacks important context and misrepresents when the deaths occured, we rate this post Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Virginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.",
        "doc": "Del. Kirk Cox has been leading Republican criticism that Virginia is off to a slow start in getting COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of citizens. Cox laid the blame on outgoing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam on Jan. 13 during the GOP response to Northam\u2019s State of the Commonwealth speech. \"The Northam administration\u2019s ability to distribute and administer vaccines has been extremely disappointing,\" Cox said. \"Ranking in the bottom third of states nationally, every state we border is doing a better job than Virginia in administering this life-saving vaccine.\" Cox, from Colonial Heights, is a former speaker of the House who is seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination this year, and his criticism is likely to become a campaign issue. So we fact checked his claim about Virginia\u2019s bottom-third ranking and found that he was being charitable in describing the roll out. The day Cox made his statement, Virginia ranked 39th among states in getting its allotted vaccine doses into people\u2019s arms, according to Becker\u2019s Hospital Review, a health systems website that, among many other things, analyzes data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since then, Virginia\u2019s ranking has fallen. On Jan. 19, the latest date of CDC data available at this writing, Virginia ranked 48th. From the 853,000 vaccines distributed to the state, 327,000 shots were given - a 38.3% rate. The national rate was 50.4%. The two states trailing Virginia were Georgia and Alabama. North Dakota had the highest rate, using 82% of its allotted vaccines for shots. Northam\u2019s response At a Jan. 14 news conference, Northam said he was satisfied with the vaccine rollout. \"This is probably one of the most massive logistical efforts that has ever taken place in Virginia, when you think about it, to get 8.5 million Virginians not one dose, but two doses,\" he said. \"I\u2019m pleased with the way we\u2019ve rolled.\" Administration officials have said published Virginia data is undercounted because of delays and glitches in the state\u2019s electronic reporting system. During the seven-day period ending on Jan. 19, Virginia averaged giving 17,464 shots a day, according to the state Department of Health\u2019s dashboard. Northam said he wants to reach 50,000 shots a day and have all Virginians double vaccinated by early to mid summer. Northam took steps last week to speed things up. He announced that all people 65 and older would now be eligible for the vaccine, and so would people aged 16 to 64 with health problems. Northam said that makes about half of Virginians eligible for vaccines. The rest will qualify later. Our ruling Cox said on Jan.13 that Virginia ranked \"in the bottom third of states nationally\" in getting its allotted COVID-19 vaccines into arms. Virginia ranked 39th in the nation on that date. Although not part of this ruling, it should be noted that Virginia has since fallen to 48th, even though it has picked up pace in giving vaccines. We rate Cox\u2019s statement True.",

        "claim": "\u201cWisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in our vaccination rate and the governor says he\u2019s \u2018satisfied.\u2019\u201d",
        "doc": "Wisconsin\u2019s vaccine distribution \u2014 like most everything else in Wisconsin in recent years \u2014 has sparked a partisan blame game. Republicans have criticized the rollout as slow and uncoordinated, asserting Democratic Gov. Tony Evers doesn\u2019t have a sufficient plan. Evers has countered that he\u2019s doing the best he can with the available supply, claiming Vice President Mike Pence had promised vaccines from a federal reserve that didn\u2019t actually exist. Republican Rebecca Kleefisch, a potential 2022 gubernatorial candidate, said Evers is leading an effort that ranks among the worst in the region. \"Wisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in our vaccination rate and the governor says he\u2019s \u2018satisfied,\u2019\" Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor under Gov. Scott Walker, said in a Jan. 14, 2021, tweet. Does Wisconsin really rank that poorly? Let\u2019s dig in. We\u2019ll leave for another day the question of who\u2019s to blame for the speed of Wisconsin\u2019s vaccine rollout. But the status is clear \u2014 Wisconsin is among the slowest in the nation. In fact, Kleefisch was over-stating the Midwest ranking. State-by-state data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed 2.4% of Wisconsin residents received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine as of Jan. 13, the most recent data available when Kleefisch sent out her tweet. That ranked dead last among the 12 Midwest states. North Dakota and South Dakota led that ranking with more than 5% receiving a first dose, while Ohio and Missouri joined Wisconsin at the bottom, with 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. In the preceding days, Wisconsin had ranked second-last in the Midwest. Nationwide as of Jan. 13, Wisconsin ranked 41st out of all 50 states in vaccination rate, well off the national average of 3.1%. The ranking only worsened in the ensuing week, with Wisconsin dropping to 44th by Jan. 19 while remaining last in the Midwest, according to the CDC. Pushing back against Kleefisch\u2019s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to CDC data on the raw number of vaccinations administered. That showed Wisconsin ranked seventh out of the 12 Midwest states as of Jan. 13. But that\u2019s not a reasonable way to compare progress when dealing with states that vary dramatically in population. It would be like arguing Texas is the highest-crime state because it has the most prison inmates. The latter may be true, but only because Texas has one of the highest populations. Comparing it to other states requires examining the number of inmates relative to the population (in which case Texas is not first). That\u2019s where the per capita rate comes in \u2014 which is the vaccination metric used by the CDC and referenced by Kleefisch. Cudaback also said Wisconsin\u2019s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups. State officials say Wisconsin has a higher proportion of long-term care residents than many states and therefore has to build a larger bank before administering vaccines, slowing the process. That brings us to the second part of Kleefisch\u2019s claim, that Evers is comfortable with where the state stands. She\u2019s off a bit there, at least in how she framed it. In a Jan. 13 interview with WISN-TV, Evers was asked, \"Is this acceptable to you where we\u2019re at\" as a state on vaccinations. \"Given what we have, we can\u2019t give any more. That\u2019s the issue,\" the governor said. \"Yes, I'm satisfied where we're at because that's all we had.\" So Evers isn\u2019t necessarily saying he\u2019s satisfied with being second-last (or last). He\u2019s saying he is satisfied with the progress given what he has had to work with. Whether that\u2019s a valid excuse is a topic for another fact check, as there are of course vaccines on hand in Wisconsin that haven\u2019t yet been administered. But he\u2019s not quite using the word in the same way Kleefisch characterized it. Cudaback also said Wisconsin\u2019s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups. State officials say Wisconsin has a higher proportion of long-term care residents than many states and therefore has to build a larger bank before administering vaccines, slowing the process. Criticizing the rollout under Evers\u2019 administration, Kleefisch said Wisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in vaccination rate. Kleefisch is making the general point that Wisconsin is in worse shape than surrounding states, and that\u2019s correct. But it\u2019s in fact even worse than she asserted. After a stretch as second-worst in the Midwest, Wisconsin moved to last on that list shortly before Kleefisch\u2019s tweet. And Evers did say around the same time he was satisfied with the state\u2019s progress, though he used the term with a caveat about vaccine availability. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "\"By revoking the Keystone pipeline permit, Biden is destroying 11,000 jobs.\u201d",
        "doc": "President Joe Biden spent his first day in the White House signing a spate of executive orders aimed at undoing the policies of the Trump administration. One of them sparked outrage on Facebook over its effect on American jobs. On Jan. 20, Biden signed an order that revoked the permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. In a Facebook post published the same day, one user said the move would cost thousands of jobs. \"By revoking the Keystone pipeline permit, Biden is destroying 11,000 jobs and roughly $2 billion in wages,\" the post says. \"Democrats couldn\u2019t even get through Day 1 without killing jobs for middle class Americans.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We\u2019ve seen several similar posts offer other figures for how many jobs were lost as a result of Biden\u2019s executive order, ranging from 12,000 to 83,000. So we wanted to take a closer look. (Screenshot from Facebook) TC Energy Corp., the Canadian company that owns the Keystone XL pipeline with the Alberta government, has said more than 1,000 people are out of work because of Biden\u2019s executive order. The 11,000 and $2 billion figures cited in the Facebook post are estimates published by the company, but most of the jobs would be temporary. We reached out to the user who published the post for their evidence, but we didn\u2019t hear back. The Keystone XL pipeline is an international project years in the making. Without support from the U.S. government, it\u2019s effectively halted. The 875-mile pipeline would carry a heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. Biden\u2019s order revokes the permit that was granted March 29, 2019, by then-President Donald Trump on the grounds that it is harmful to the environment. While an 11-volume State Department report on the Keystone XL pipeline found in 2014 that it would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution, critics say the project threatens Alberta\u2019s rivers and forests. And the project has become a symbol for the political debate over fossil fuels. The Obama-era State Department had denied TC Energy\u2019s request for a permit in 2015. Trump revived hopes for the project once he took office, ultimately approving it with an executive order. Construction began in April 2020, but that same month, a federal court said that the project had to go through a full endangered species review. TC Energy appealed the ruling, but the Supreme Court upheld it in July. Before Biden signed his executive order, only a 1.2-mile section of the pipeline had been completed in Montana near the U.S.-Canada border. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve fact-checked many claims that the Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of American jobs. Several of them lack context about the duration and nature of these positions,and this Facebook post is similar. In a Jan. 20 statement, TC Energy said Biden\u2019s order \"would directly lead to the layoff of thousands of union workers.\" It did not specify exactly how many jobs would be lost. President Richard Prior told the Associated Press that the layoffs would number more than 1,000. We reached out to TC Energy for more information, but we haven\u2019t heard back. The 11,000 figure in the Facebook post appears to stem from an Oct. 28 press release on the pipeline\u2019s website. In October, TC Energy awarded contracts to six American union contractors to build the Keystone XL pipeline in three states in 2021. Those contractors were \"responsible for hiring 7,000 union workers.\" RELATED: Keystone XL pipeline: Unbuilt, opposed by Biden, mired in lawsuits \"When combined with additional 2021 contracts to be announced later, the total number of American union workers constructing Keystone XL in 2021 will exceed 8,000 and $900 million in gross wages,\" the release said. \"In total, Keystone XL is expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021, creating more than $1.6 billion in gross wages.\" That\u2019s close to what the State Department found in its 2014 report. In the report, the agency wrote that 10,400 estimated positions would be for seasonal construction work lasting four to eight-month periods. Since the State Department defines \"job\" as \"one position that is filled for 1 year,\" that would equate to approximately 3,900 jobs over a two-year period. In short: Most of the estimated jobs were temporary. The State Department forecasted that no more than 50 jobs, some of which could be located in Canada, would be required to maintain the pipeline. Thirty-five of them would be permanent, while 15 would be temporary contractors. We reached out to the White House for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back. A Facebook post says that Biden\u2019s executive order revoking the Keystone XL pipeline \"is destroying 11,000 jobs.\" That number is an estimate, and the claim lacks context about the longevity of Keystone jobs. TC Energy said more than 1,000 people are out of work because of Biden\u2019s executive order. In October, the company said it expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021 and generate more than $1.6 billion in gross wages. But both TC Energy and the State Department have said the majority of those jobs would be temporary. A 2014 report found that the company would need only 50 employees to maintain the Keystone XL pipeline once it\u2019s finished, 35 of them permanent. Temporary jobs are still jobs. But this post could leave the wrong impression without full context. We rate it Half True.",

        "doc": "Sen. Pat Toomey this week criticized President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, saying the direct payments Biden wants to send Americans are poorly targeted to those most in need. \"There will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever,\" Toomey (R., Pa.) said Tuesday during a Senate confirmation hearing for Janet Yellen, Biden\u2019s nominee for Treasury secretary. We wondered just how much such families will receive if Biden\u2019s plan is signed into law. Toomey is right. Married couples making up to $150,000 annually would qualify for $2,800 in new payments, on top of the $1,200 they should have received this month from the relief package then-President Donald Trump signed into law late last year. Together, those payments would total $2,000 per person \u2014 the target Democrats in Congress set, Trump made a late and unsuccessful push for, and that Biden is now pursuing from the White House. Individuals making up to $75,000 would qualify for $1,400 in new aid on top of the $600 payments they just got. And adults with dependent children ages 16 and younger would qualify for an additional $600 per child. Analysts estimate this component of Biden\u2019s plan could cost $465 billion. During the Senate Finance Committee hearing, which took place the day before Biden\u2019s inauguration, Toomey argued against direct payments for upper middle class families who haven\u2019t endured any loss of income during the pandemic. Yellen acknowledged the payments aren\u2019t designed to target the people hurting the most, but rather intended to support families and stimulate the economy broadly. \"Some families presumably don\u2019t greatly need the money, but there are many families who are under stress,\" Yellen told Toomey. The eligibility criteria for direct payments under Biden\u2019s plan mirrors the one Congress agreed to a few weeks ago, which set the upper income limit for the smallest payments at $174,000 for a married couple. Toomey told Yellen it would be tough to find bipartisan support for Biden\u2019s proposal, but several Senate Republicans have already endorsed the idea, including Marco Rubio of Florida, Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Democrats were first to pitch the idea of $2,000 per person direct payments, but it was Trump who made a late push for them in December, threatening to withhold his support for the relief package unless the payments were included. He eventually relented and signed the package into law without the larger payments. Toomey said families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption will get several thousand dollars in payments under Biden\u2019s coronavirus relief package. That\u2019s right. Couples who make up to $150,000 annually will get $2,800, plus $600 for each child age 16 and under, on top of payments received from the last relief package. We rate the statement True.",

        "claim": "Says that the Paris Climate Accord will cost the U.S. economy \"6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040.\"",
        "doc": "Wayne Christian is fed up withenvironmentalistsand what he described as the \"woke\" liberal policies threatening to disruptthe smooth recovery ofTexas\u2019energy sectorfrom pandemic blows. TheRepublicanoil and gasregulator,one of threecommissionersof the Texas Railroad Commission,penneda missive earlier this monththat took aim at those who've recently cast Texas natural gasin a bad light \u2014 the French government for cutting ties with aHoustoncompanyover environmental concerns,the \"sensationalist fake-news media\" for downplayingimprovements inemissions, andthe \"environmental extremists\"forpromoting Green New Deal policies. Inthe letter,postedto the agency\u2019s website onJan. 5, Christian took a swipe at President Joe Biden\u2019s pledgeto rejointhe Paris Climate Accord,which he fulfilled on his first day in office by executive order. Former President Donald Trumpwithdrew in 2017 fromthe international treaty, designed to reducecarbon emissions, althoughterms of the agreement stipulated that the U.S. could not formally exit until Nov. 4, 2020. \"This would be a tremendous mistake,\" Christian wrote.\"The accord carries sky-high costs with very low benefits and unfairly imposes a double standard based on unproven assumptions and climate models that are wrong nearly all the time.\" Then Christian pointed to a2017studyreleased by an economic research firmon behalf oftheU.S. Chamber of Commerce and theAmerican Council for Capital Formation, apro-businessthink tank on economic policy. \"The cost of the Paris Climate Accord to the American economy is steep. The agreement will cost American workers 6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040,\" Christian wrote, citing the 2017study. The study, entitled \"Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Regulations On theIndustrial Sector,\" was also cited by Trump when justifying hisdecision towithdrawfrom theParisaccord. \"The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that,\" Trump saidinhis2017announcement from the Rose Garden. The bleak outlook sparked scrutiny over the figures.When theU.S.initially joined the accord in 2016,the Obamaadministration set long-term goals for reducingeconomy-wide emissions by 80%from2005 levels by 2050. The administration listed a mixofexisting and plannedpolicies that would help the U.S. meet that goal, butreductionsstemmingfromthosepolicieswould still fall short of the 2050 target. Althoughthere\u2019s debate overhow far short the policies would come, \"it is clear that such a gap cannot be filled without contributions from the industrial sector,\" reads the study, which wasconductedby NERA Economic Consulting.The profit and job loss figures cited by Christian and Trump represent the economic costof closing that gap according to NERA\u2019s analysis. Trump and Christianrepeat the report\u2019s findings accurately.More restrictions on fossil fuel emissionsmean higher cost of production, and higher cost of production means the closure ofuncompetitivemanufacturing businesses, and thoseclosuresmean fewer manufacturing jobs.These lossesandtheir knock-on effectsbeyond the manufacturing sector would amount to 1.1 million jobs lost by 2025 and 6.5 million by 2040, according to NERA. The loss of jobs results in a corresponding decline in gross domestic product,with a loss of $250 billion by 2025 that accelerates to $3 trillion by 2040. \"The decline in GDP accelerates over time as the targets become much more difficult to comply with and the targets start to constrain output in all sectors,\" the study says. But the study\u2019s authors note an important caveat totheirkey findingsthat Trump andChristianomit.Not only are the long-term projections subject to a great deal of uncertainty,they said,the studydid notfactor in all of theoffsettingjob gains and GDP growth associated with aclean tech transition. In anewsrelease followingTrump\u2019s announcement ofU.S.withdrawal from the Parisagreement, NERAstated that \"the Trump administration selectively used results\" from its study. \"NERA\u2019s study was not a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one,\" their statement said.\"The objective of the study was to estimate the range of cost sensitivity associated with meeting deep U.S.emissions targets under alternative implementation approaches affecting U.S.industrial sectors. NERA\u2019s study does not provide any recommendations regarding any specific international agreements.\" There\u2019s a smattering of predictions for how climate action will create opportunities for economic growth.For instance, a 2018 report by the Global Commission on the Economy andClimate\u2014 aneconomic policyinitiativecommissioned by seven countriesin 2013\u2014says that the green transition couldcreate$26 trillion in benefitsacross the global economyby 2030. And as new technologies accelerate thetransition, new jobs could be created therewith. For example, over a millionAmericansare employed in the fossil fuel sectorwhileclose to half that amountare employed in solar and wind,even though solar and wind comprise just 10% of the energy mix,according to thecommission's report. \"It is expected that reduced employment in fossil fuels through the transition can be more than offset by a rise in employment in renewables and construction,\" the study said. Globally, the commission found that low-carbonjobsmay employ up to 65 million people by 2030, which could offset employment reductions in declining sectors. When asked about considering possibleoffsettingbenefitsin his criticism of the Paris accord, Christianonly questioned the logic of eliminating existing energy jobs while subsidizing jobs inrenewables.According tothe International Renewable Energy Agency,globaldirect subsidies to renewables are expected to increasefrom $166 billion in 2017 to$192 billion in 2030,while subsidies to fossil fuelsfall from $447billion to $165 billion over the same 13-year period. \"I do not see a benefit in putting in place punitive policies that eliminate well-paying energy jobs and then using our taxpayer dollars to create new jobs through subsidizing other less efficient forms of energy,\" he said. Under the Paris accord, the U.S. committed to reducing emissions by about 25% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. Biden\u2019s move to rejoin the accord means thatthe U.S. must submit an emission reduction plan, although the details arenot yet known. \"Since our state makes up 40% of the nation's production, we will be disproportionately impacted compared to other states in terms of economic and job loss,\" Christian said. The NERA report also doesn\u2019t factor inthe cost of climate-related disastersthat, by most scientific accounts, are projected to increase in frequency as global temperatures rise.Over the past two decades,globalclimate-related disasters \u2014 primarily floods and storms \u2014 accounted for$2.3 trillion in damages, with the U.S. bearing the brunt of the economic losses, according to a report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.Under afuture scenario withlimited or no emission reductions, these disasters are expected to worsenin severity and frequency,meaning that a business-as-usual response to climate change cancost the economy trillions. \"Current economic models are deeply inadequate in capturing the opportunities of such a transformational shift, or the grave dangers of climate inaction,\" the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate study says.\"We need a new class of economic models that can capture the powerful dynamics at play, including technological advances, preservation of essential natural capital, and the full health benefits of cleaner air and a safer climate including the containment of pandemic diseases.\" Like Trump, Christian has beenvocal skeptic of climate science.He was first electedtothe Railroad Commission in 2016having attracted endorsements and contributions from industry groups, energy companies and other state officials. He\u2019s repeatedly made argumentsagainstglobal warming and its man-made causes,calling those who underscorefuture impacts of climate change \"climate catastrophists.\" \"These activists repeatedly imply that climate change is \u2018settled science\u2019 and that 97 percent of scientists agree that the main reasonfor global warming is manmade greenhousegasses.However, real science is never \u2018settled\u2019 and 97 percent of scientists don\u2019t agree. ... This is far from settled science,\" Christian wrotein a 2019 letter to Gov. Greg Abbott. A2016 survey of scientificstudiesfound that97% of actively publishing climate scientists agreed on thecause ofglobal warming. \"The vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists \u2013 97 percent \u2013 agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change,\" according to NASA. \"Most of the leading science organizations around the world have issued public statements expressing this, including international and U.S. science academies, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a whole host of reputable scientific bodies around the world.\" Christian wrote in an open letterthat reentry into the ParisClimateAccord will \"cost American workers 6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040,\"accuratelyciting a studyreleased in 2017 by NERA Economic Consulting. Those figures were similarlyreferenced by Trumpin justification ofhis decision towithdrawfrom theaccord.After that announcement, authors of the studysaid the \"Trumpadministration selectively used results\" and failed to consider key limitations oftheir findings. Christian similarly omitted these caveats. We rate this claimHalf True.",

        "doc": "The domain name \"antifa.com\" caused a flurry in September 2020 when it redirected and took visitors to Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign website instead. One day after Biden was sworn in as the 46th president, the domain began pulling up the White House\u2019s official website, whitehouse.gov, causing yet another stir. \"ATTENTION!! Go to Antifa dot com (the correct way) and it takes you to Biden's Whitehouse!!!!\" reads a popular post on Facebook. \"What is going on?? I know b4 it went to his campaign but to put WH on it! Just a slap in the face.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here\u2019s what is going on. The way the internet works, any person can buy an available domain name such as antifa.com and set it to redirect to another website, without any involvement from the site it\u2019s being redirected to. In this case, whoever owns the domain \u2014 and the owner remains anonymous \u2014 is purposefully redirecting it to the White House site, possibly as a joke, an oblique form of commentary, or to cause mischief or confusion. There\u2019s no evidence that Biden\u2019s campaign or administration had anything to do with it. The redirect setting for antifa.com had changed several times before, forwarding to joebiden.com, kamalaharris.org, buildbackbetter.org, and a self-described anarchist website, itsgoingdown.org. We did not hear back from the White House about the current redirect, but Biden\u2019s campaign denied any association with the previous antifa.com redirects. So whoever owns https://t.co/HgEpqQ9MqZ is redirecting it to our website as a troll. What we do know was that the website was registered with a Russian registrar for a while. Odd!The VP very obviously has/wants nothing to do with fringe groups. Wish Trump could say the same. Computer experts told us that redirecting a domain name is no different from forwarding a telephone number or mailing address. The person on the receiving end can\u2019t do much to stop it. \"Basically the way things work with domain names is, if you own a domain name, whether you\u2019re the original purchaser or you purchased it from someone else, you can redirect your domain name to anywhere you wanted it to go,\" Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Computer Systems Security, told PolitiFact in September. \"And that doesn\u2019t require permission or any or coordination from the person you are trying to redirect to.\" Neuman found that the antifa.com domain was first registered in 2000, and according to Whois, an online domain registry, it was last updated on Jan. 21, 2021. The registrant is listed as WhoisGuard Protected, meaning the domain owner is using a service to remain anonymous. The post is partially accurate \u2014 the domain does redirect to the White House\u2019s website \u2014 but in implying that Biden\u2019s White House is involved, it leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

        "claim": "In Michigan, \u201cwe were able to really flatten\u201d the racial disparity in COVID-19\u2019s impact \u201cand make significant progress.\u201d",
        "doc": "Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who chairs the state\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities, claimed that steps taken by communities of color, along with state and local efforts, have helped alleviate COVID-19\u2019s disproportionate impact on Black residents. \"I\u2019m proud to report that in the State of Michigan, we were able to really flatten that disparity and make significant progress,\" he said at an MLK Jr. Day Youth Conference. Black residents make up 13.7% of Michigan\u2019s population. But in April, they accounted for 42.93% of COVID-19 deaths, according to a Detroit Free Press analysis. That share has steadily decreased, and hit a low of 7.08% in November. Even during the second wave of the pandemic that began in the fall, the case rate among Black residents mostly remained below the rate for white people, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Michigan seems to have bucked the national trend, as Black communities across the country continue to experience disproportionately high death rates. Gilchrist said the shift \"is a tribute and a testimony, frankly, to people of color stepping up and doing the right things to keep themselves and their families safe.\" He also credited local and state efforts to address COVID-19\u2019s toll on communities of color. It is impossible to know for sure what\u2019s driving the trend. Experts we talked to backed up Gilchrist\u2019s claim, but also pointed to other factors, including the way the pandemic has spread beyond the early hot spots. The disparities have closed statewide. But Dr. Philip Levy, a professor at the Wayne State University School of Medicine, attributed the shift in part to Detroit. The onset of the pandemic in late March hit southeast Michigan hard, and Detroit \u2014 where the population is nearly 80% Black \u2014 became a hot spot. But the city is no longer leading the surge in cases and deaths in Michigan. In early November, cases began raging in western Michigan. And in the late fall and early winter, the Upper Peninsula saw a big increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths. In the most recent phase, Detroit has stood out for its low infection rate, even compared with the rest of the metro area. \"Despite the rise, Detroit has stayed down,\" said Levy. \"Something must be going on, and the secret sauce, I think, is in the people themselves.\" Dawn Misra, an epidemiologist at Michigan State University who conducted a mortality review of Michiganders who died from COVID-19, said she suspects that the personal impact of the pandemic on the lives of Detroiters led the city\u2019s residents to take the virus seriously. \"Everyone who lives in Detroit ended up being probably close to someone they knew who died,\" Misra said. Levy said Detroiters\u2019 early and personal experiences led them to embrace mask-wearing and social distancing. \"I think people really stepped up for their own personal responsibility and really recognized that they had an important role to play in this, and if people didn\u2019t do that more people that they knew were going to die,\" he said. Black Michiganders across the state have embraced mask-wearing. A survey conducted by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services over the summer found that 81% of Black Michiganders reported that they always wear a mask, compared with 69% of the rest of the population. \"They listened to the science,\" Misra said. Misra also credited state and local efforts to reduce racial disparities. For instance, as cases surged in Detroit, the city rolled out rapid testing for first responders, bus drivers and health care workers, becoming the first city in the country to do so. Levy helped launch a mobile testing program in Detroit that deployed vehicles to neighborhoods where cases were rising. These wereamong many efforts to ramp up testing in the city, said Misra. In late April, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer established the task force to examine racial disparities during the pandemic. Michigan is only one of a dozen states with such a task force, according to the National Governors\u2019 Association. The state\u2019s task force set up neighborhood testing sites in at-risk communities, launched media campaigns in urban communities on wearing masks and testing and provided personal protective equipment and food for quarantined individuals. But another factor in the narrowing racial disparity is the increase in cases in predominantly white areas in the state. Jon Zelner, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said the worsening pandemic is an \"underappreciated factor\" in explaining the reduction in racial disparities. \"Some of the narrowing of that gap unfortunately kind of comes from an increase in overall case burden,\" he said. \"When you see white deaths going up, the ratio looks better,\" he added. Gilchrist claimed that Michigan has seen significant progress in reducing the racial disparities observed at the outset of the pandemic, particularly the disproportionate impact on Black residents, and credited community, state and local efforts. Public health experts and officials say Black residents as well as the state and local governments made significant efforts to narrow the disparity. But a surge in cases among white people has also contributed, as the impact of the pandemic spread beyond Detroit into predominantly white areas around the state.

        "doc": "In the final days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, a 2018 social media post resurfaced featuring one of Trump\u2019s sharpest critics, California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters. The post shows two images of Waters, each overlaid with a quote attributed to her. The first: \"We\u2019re sending a message to every Trump supporting American that you\u2019re not welcome here.\" The second: \"We must welcome everyone who crosses our borders, whether they are illegal or not.\" A caption next to the image, which was shared 44,000 times, captures the irony of the supposed quotes: \"So actual Americans are unwelcome but illegals are welcome? Thanks for clearing that up.\" However, neither quote is accurate. And while Waters did make statements suggesting Trump Cabinet members should be singled out in public, she did not direct her comments at Trump supporters broadly, as this post suggests. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In searches of Google and Nexis news archives, we found no evidence that Waters had uttered either quote. But the post appears to allude to the Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy on immigration, announced in April 2018. The policy led to the separation of nearly 3,000 children from their parents when families tried to enter the United States at the Mexico border without permission. We did find that on June 23, 2018, Waters made comments about Trump\u2019s Cabinet members during a rally in Los Angeles. During the event, she demanded that children separated at the border be reunited with their parents. Her comments came one day after the owner of a restaurant in Lexington, Va., refused to serve then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and asked her to leave, saying Sanders works in an \"inhumane and unethical\" administration. Waters said at the rally: \"We want the children back. We want them connected to their parents. We want it done now. We\u2019re going to insist on it. If you think we\u2019re rallying now, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. Already you have members of your Cabinet that are being booed out of restaurants, who are \u2014 protesters taking up at their house, who are saying, \u2018no peace, no sleep; no peace, no sleep.\u2019\" She added: \"And so, let\u2019s stay the course. Let\u2019s make sure we show up, wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere. We\u2019ve got to get the children connected to their parents.\" A Facebook post says Waters said Trump supporters are \"not welcome here\" and that \"we must welcome everyone who crosses our borders.\" Neither quote is accurate. Waters did say that members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet are \"not welcome anymore, anywhere\" in a June 2018 critique of the administration\u2019s zero-tolerance immigration policy, one that led to the separation of children from their parents at the Mexico border. But she did not direct her comments at all Trump supporters as this post suggests. We rate this post Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Says President Joe Biden sparked a migrant caravan from Honduras and questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops at the inauguration.",
        "doc": "President Joe Biden had been in office only for a few hours when claims began to circulate about how he had already failed in his new role. \"It has been a terrible start for \u2018the big guy,\u2019\" Restoration PAC, a super PAC based in suburban Chicago, posted on Facebook on Jan. 20, following the late-morning presidential inauguration. An accompanying image read: \"4 Biden failures before taking office: Sparked an immigration crisis \u2014 migrant caravan from Honduras is moving towards the US border; questioned the loyalty of US troops in Washington D.C.; invoked race during the U.S. Capitol riot \u2014 said BLM would be treated differently by police; calls for unity but goes along with the divisive impeachment.\" For this fact-check, we focused on the first two points. The latter two are accurate: Biden said Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated differently than U.S. Capitol rioters were, and his assessment is supported by several examinations that compared police responses to summer protests for racial justice with the riot. And Biden supports the impeachment trial, which he has said he thinks the Senate can juggle with its usual business. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As a super PAC, Restoration PAC has few limits on fundraising or spending to advocate for or against political candidates. In the 2020 election cycle, Restoration PAC spent $18.7 million on communications to oppose Democrats, and $1 million on communications supporting Republicans. The claim that Biden \"sparked an immigration crisis\" draws a connection between his actions and a migrant caravan from Honduras that the Facebook post says \"is moving toward the U.S. border.\" The migrants were attempting to flee Honduras, beset for years by poverty and gang violence and now ravaged by COVID-19. The already desperate conditions in the country were worsened by two major hurricanes in November that left many people without jobs or homes. By the time the Facebook post was published, though, the caravan had already dissipated in Guatemala, stopped by roadblocks where Guatemalan forces used tear gas and batons to turn back the group of thousands. It is not uncommon for migration to occur around the time of U.S. elections and transitions of power, NBC News reported, citing spikes in late 2016, early 2017 and 2018 around the time of the midterm elections. Opponents of Biden\u2019s immigration plans have sought to link his proposals to the caravan\u2019s movement. U.S. Rep Ken Buck, R-Colo., tweeted a video on Jan. 20 of the Honduran migrants clashing with Guatemalan soldiers, writing, \"This is what happens when you announce plans to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. Joe Biden\u2019s open borders plan has consequences.\" But a Biden proposal to provide a route to citizenship for immigrants illegally in the country would apply only to people who were already in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021, to deter migrants from moving toward the U.S. border. The Facebook post\u2019s claim that Biden \"questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington, D.C.\" does not include examples or specifics. It likely is related to the decision to vet all National Guard troops assigned to the city for the inauguration, after concerns about extremism and insider threats. PolitiFact did not find any published comments from Biden or his representatives about the vetting process or the loyalty of the National Guard. The screening resulted in 12 National Guard members being removed from inaugural duties. Two of them had made extremist statements about the event, the Associated Press reported. \"This type of vetting often takes place by law enforcement for significant security events,\" said Christopher Miller, the Acting Secretary of Defense under Trump, in a Jan. 18 statement. \"However, in this case the scope of military participation is unique.\" Regarding the scope, 25,000 members of the National Guard were deployed for Biden\u2019s inauguration, compared with more than 7,000 for Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration. The National Guard presence at inaugural events was beefed up following a Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, and the background checks were added after the discovery that ex-military members had participated in the riot. Nine of the people arrested for participating in the riot were former U.S. military members, ABC News reported. One of the five people who died as a result of the riot was a U.S. Air Force veteran shot by police as she climbed through a window near the House chamber. We contacted Restoration PAC for comment but did not receive a reply. A Facebook post attacking Biden\u2019s pre-presidential \"failures\" blamed him for a migrant caravan from Honduras and said he questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington. Biden\u2019s proposal to provide a route to citizenship for immigrants is only applicable to people who were already in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021. The caravan that had been headed for the U.S. border disbanded. PolitiFact did not find any evidence that Biden questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington. The decision to vet the National Guard members deployed for the inauguration followed the discovery that ex-military members had participated in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. We rate these claims Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d",
        "doc": "State lawmakers have been among those pushing the Cuomo administration to allow all high school sports to resume, even those the state deems \"higher risk\" such as wrestling, competitive cheerleading, basketball and hockey. In a news conference on Jan. 14, Assemblymember Colin Schmitt, a Republican who represents parts of Orange and Rockland counties, said neighboring states have allowed students to play and New York should follow suit. \"We have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports,\" he said. Last week, the New York State Department of Health announced those sports will be allowed to return Feb. 1. Now the question has become even more important to a lot of families whose children may want to play: Is Schmitt right? Does scientific data show itis safe to play amid a pandemic? We approached Schmitt\u2019s office about his claim, and his chief of staff, Taylor Weyeneth, sent us information from several sources. He reiterated Schmitt\u2019s statement that with Covid-19 safety measures in place, sports can resume without a high risk of transmission. A news story from earlier this month dealt with rapid testing of student athletes in Michigan. The 4,000-plus students who played football and volleyball and competed in swimming competitions took a test before they practiced or competed. The state found 99.6% of the tests came back negative since testing began Dec. 30. A University of Wisconsin study of Covid-19 and high school sports, published in October, wasbased on surveys of 207 high school athletic departments that had re-started sports. Those departments accounted for more than 30,000 students, 4,000 games and 16,000 practicesduring September. The sports included, but were not limited to, cheerleading, soccer and football. The survey showed 271 coronavirus cases reported among the students, with only one case traced back to school sports. The infection rate among high school student athletes was lower than the rate among the general population of their peers, the authors wrote. We asked the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health about the study. The school\u2019s dean, Dr. Robert N. Golden, said in a statement that the study does not represent the views of the school, and he cautioned the data came from high school athletic departments and that the study had not been peer-reviewed. \"High schools across the country are working to make the best decisions they can regarding the health and safety of their athletes, and we do not believe this report should play a major role in shaping their decisions,\" said Golden. A survey in Kentucky tracked responses from more than 12,000 high school football players and support staff. The survey, conducted by football coaches and reported on by the Cincinnati Enquirer, found that less than 1% of participants reported being infected with the coronavirus after two months of meetings and practices. None of thecases could be traced back to workouts. Not everyone was tested. The data was collected in an effort to persuade state officials to resume play, according to the Enquirer. We asked experts about the risk of Covid-19 spread among high school athletes allowed to play amid the pandemic. Dr. Chad Asplund, a primary care and sports medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said from what is known,the majority of the infections do not occur during games, but through everything that goes with them: meals, travel and hanging out with teammates. \"But from the data available, it appears that there has not been a significant amount of transmission during athletic contests,\" Asplund said. As far as which sports are riskier, he said that those with more direct contact, such as wrestling, are more likely to transmit the virus between athletes, while outdoor sports are less likely. Indoor sports pose more risk, but some of that can be mitigated with improved ventilation and air flow. He also said spectators should be masked and socially distant, especially indoors in an enclosed space, such as a hockey rink. Ice hockey, considered \"higher risk\" in New York, has been deemed the source of several clusters or outbreaks around the country, including in Minnesota, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. During an amateur indoor hockey game between adults in Florida, 13 were infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"The indoor space and close contact between players during a hockey game increase infection risk for players and create potential for a superspreader event, especially with ongoing community COVID-19 transmission,\" CDC researchers wrote. The American Academy of Pediatrics says ice hockey in particular \"carries a higher relative risk.\" Regarding all youth sports, the academy cautions that the number of players, the frequency and duration of contact, and whether students are playing outside or inside can influence whether infection will be transmitted during school sports. \"Risk can be decreased but not eliminated by athletes, parents, coaches, and officials following safety protocols,\" according to the academy\u2019s guidance from December. Dr. Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, studies Covid-19 transmission. While his lab hasn\u2019t studied this specific question, he said safe sporting events are doable with rapid tests before practices and games, twice-weekly PCR testing, contact tracing, air filtration, and proper mask wearing. Dr. IngridIchesco, who specializes in pediatric sports medicine at Michigan Medicine C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital, said there\u2019s many benefits with sports from a physical and mental standpoint, and those benefits have to be weighed against the risks. \"Obviously, anything where you\u2019re in close proximity there\u2019s a risk for Covid transmission,\" she said. Schmitt said scientific data shows it\u2019s safe to play all sports while following health and safety protocols, even those considered \"high risk.\" But the data that Schmitt provided did not address all of the high-risk sports. There are indications that participation in certain sports does not lead to greater transmission of the virus. And the University of Maryland professor we talked to said he believes high school students can play sports safely by following the right precautions. But the key word in Schmitt's statement is \"scientific.\" Tallying survey results is not conclusive scientific evidence regarding all of the sports that Schmitt wantedto see resumed, such as wrestling and ice hockey. Even the medical school dean at the University of Wisconsin advised against relying on a colleague's report because it wasn't peer reviewed and the data collection depended on the high schools. If Schmitt had said \"mounting evidence\" or \"early indications\" show playing high school sports is safe amid a pandemic, that would not have been false. But he said \"scientific data,\" which implies amore rigorous standard has been met. It hasn't. We rate Schmitt\u2019s claim Mostly False.",

Joe Biden talking about immigration in some entirely different ways than he does today,\" reads the title and caption to the video, which has been shared more than a thousand times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post appeared on American Voices Facebook page, which has nearly 3 million followers. The account says that it is affiliated with the Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news website. Daily Caller\u2019s watermark shows in the upper-right corner of the video. For this fact-check, PolitiFact reviewed the video as well as Biden\u2019s past positions and statements on border security and his modern-day policy stances on immigration and border control. We found that he did support 2006 legislation funding a 700-mile fence at the southern U.S. border, but his statements at the time do not signify a significant departure from his current support for border security and other measures to control immigration into the U.S. Let\u2019s look. The three-minute video posted on Facebook starts with about a one-minute clip of fuzzy footage in which then-Sen. Biden is seen speaking to a group of people seated at tables. This clip comes from a Nov. 27, 2006, talk Biden gave to the Columbia (S.C.) Rotary Club. It was recorded by Brad Warthen, who was then editorial page editor for The State newspaper in Columbia. In it, Biden says: \"I voted for 700 miles of fence. But let me tell you, we can build a fence 40 stories high. Unless we change the dynamic in Mexico and \u2014 and you will not like this \u2014 and punish employers who knowingly violate the law when they hire illegals, unless you do those two things, all the rest is window dressing... \"And the reason why I,parenthetically, why I believe the fence is needed does not have anything to do with immigration, as much as drugs. I\u2019m the guy that wrote the national crime bill. I\u2019m the guy that wrote the national drug trafficking. I\u2019m the guy that wrote the law that set up a drug czar. And let me tell you something folks, people are driving across that border with tons, tons \u2014 hear me \u2014 tons of everything from byproducts for methamphetamine to cocaine to heroin.\" The video then splices together more recent footage from Biden\u2019s statements on immigration and border protection during the 2020 campaign, including a pledge to create a pathway to citizenship for people living in the United States without a legal status. The vote Biden references was for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was squarely aimed at reducing illegal immigration along the southern border. It was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by Republican President George W. Bush. The bill passed the Senate, 80-19, with Biden and then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton among 26 Democrats voting for it. The law authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Bush described it as part of his efforts toward comprehensive immigration reform. The Boston Globe in 2017 noted that Democrats who were normally in favor of looser immigration laws viewed the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils. Around that same time, the House passed legislation that would make any immigrant illegally in the country a felon. Biden said in the clip that his vote was mainly targeted at drug trafficking. But he also indicated that he doesn\u2019t believe border security depends on the wall. He said he supported a variety of measures much as he does today, such as addressing root causes for why people seek to leave their homes for the United States. Biden campaigned for the presidency saying he would not take down border barriers or add more. He wants to use technology to maintain border security and to invest $4 billion to tackle the factors motivating Central Americans to migrate to the United States. A Facebook post says that a video shows Biden boasted in 2006 \"about voting for \u2018700 miles of fence\u2019\" and \"talking about immigration in some entirely different ways than he does today.\" In the 2006 video clip, Biden did talk about voting for a 700-mile fence. He said he made the vote mainly to fight drug trafficking, not illegal immigration, but the 2006 Secure Fence Act was squarely aimed at stemming illegal immigration along the southern border. Biden in 2006 supported a variety of measures to fight illegal immigration much as he does today, including addressing root causes that lead people to flee their homes south of the U.S.-Mexico border for the United States. In that respect, Biden\u2019s position is not so different. The post is partially accurate but leaves out important details \u2014 our definition of Half True.",

        "claim": "\u201cNew York leads the nation in out-migration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade.\u201d",
        "doc": "Has New York state seen bigger losses in population from out-migration than any other state? That\u2019s what state Sen. Jim Tedisco said in a press release issued with fellow members of the Senate Republican Conference On Jan. 5, Senate Republicans unveiled their plan to \"Reset New York State,\" saying they sought to lower taxes, improve local economies and get smarter about addressing the coronavirus pandemic. In the release, Tedisco said that in order for New York to address its economic challenges, the Legislature must first grapple with the pattern of New York residents fleeing the state for other locales. \"In order to reset New York State by safely restarting our economy, we need to address the elephant in the room that our state government is not talking about: the fact that for the third year in a row, New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade,\" Tedisco said in the release. \"When enough people who can afford to leave New York State are gone, who will be left to pay for the infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities?\" New York has indeed experienced population losses over the past decade, we found, but the nature of the losses isnot quite as Tedisco suggests. Adam Kramer, Tedisco\u2019s chief of staff and director of communications, directed PolitiFact\u2019s reporters to several articles referring to the total population decline of 126,000 people, but this figure isn\u2019t necessarily tied to domestic out-migration. Kramer cited the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s new population figures released on Dec. 22, 2020, which show changes between July 2019 and July 2020. The figures show that New York\u2019s population decreased by 126,355 people during that period, or a 0.65% drop from a year earlier. That was the nation\u2019s largest loss of population for that period, with Illinois having the second-biggest loss. However, it\u2019s important to note that the population loss figure is not necessarily attributable to out-migration to other states. The figure also reflects net international migration and natural increases from births minus deaths, said William Frey, chief demographer at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. In 2020, deaths could be a significant factor, since New York experienced roughly 25,000 coronavirus deaths during the period reflected in the Census statistics. The Census Bureau has not yet released a more detailed breakdown of population changes from 2019 to 2020, so it\u2019s not clear yet how much of New York\u2019s population loss stems from migration to other states. That said, recent history supports Tedisco claim that New York has experienced significant migration to other states. This brings us to his second assertion. Census data shows that between 2010 and 2019, New York state gained about 75,000 people overall. However, the population losses to other states were substantial \u2014 almost 1.38 million people. This was larger than any other state, with California ranking second. The reason for the overall gain is that the domestic losses were more than balanced out by a net gain of 698,000 from international migration and a net gain of more than 758,000 from births minus deaths. The breakdown for domestic out-migration isn\u2019t available yet for 2020, but figures are available for the overall population figure. They showthat New York\u2019s small overall population gain from 2010 to 2019 was reversed by 2020, with the state losing almost 117,000 between 2010 and 2020. When Tedisco made his claim, his Republican colleagues largely blamed the state government for the population decline. Sen. Joseph Griffo said in the statement that people are leaving New York because of \"unwelcome policies, burdensome regulations and high taxes,\" while Sen. George Borrello cited \"high taxes, excessive, job-killing regulations, and a rising crime rate\" as reasons for population loss. Tom W. Smith, senior fellow and director of the University of Chicago\u2019s Center for the Study of Politics and Society, said that these factors may help cause out-migration, but he added that other factors can as well, even the prevailing weather. Despite Tedisco\u2019s assertion that out-migration will make it difficult for New York to be able to pay for infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities in the future, Frey said New York\u2019s population losses aren\u2019t enough to cause that. \"While there may continue to be a negative domestic out-migration from New York, it has not been dramatically different than the past, especially when compared with the early 2000s,\" he said. Tedisco said that \"New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade.\" New York has seen significant population losses for a decade, exceeding the losses in other states. However, he described the one-year loss of 126,000 incorrectly. That figure refers to net population changes for all reasons, including gains from international in-migration and births minus deaths.

Rick Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, criticized Biden\u2019s move. \"We have to stop joining deals that are bad for America,\" Scott said in a statement to the press. \"President Biden is throwing the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement just to appease his liberal friends. This deal does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable.\" There\u2019s debate over how well the agreement\u2019s overall approach will meet the challenge of climate change. Here, we focus on Scott\u2019s claim that the agreement puts the U.S. at a disadvantage because it does nothing to hold \"real\" polluters like China and India accountable. Under the agreement, each country submits a set of greenhouse gas reduction targets called a Nationally Determined Contribution. Countries have been sending these to the United Nations since they launched the agreement in 2015, with new or updated goals due in 2020, and every five years after that. For example, in its 2016 plan, China said that by 2030, it would lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% compared with 2005 releases. So, while its emissions would rise as its economy grew, they wouldn\u2019t rise as much as they would have if everything worked the way it did in 2005. China said it would aim for carbon dioxide emissions to peak in about 2030. India set a more modest goal of cutting emissions by 33% to 35% per unit of GDP by 2030. Both China and India had additional goals on their list. Scott said the agreement has no way to hold nations accountable if they stray from meeting their goals. Benjamin Zycher, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, said Scott has a point. \"The Nationally Determined Contributions are strictly voluntary,\" Zycher said. \"There is no enforcement mechanism.\" Zycher is no fan of the Paris agreement. But even those who think it holds promise agree that it lacks teeth. \"There are no penalties other than naming and shaming if these pledges are too weak or are not fulfilled,\" said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. Countries are required to report their progress publicly. Law professor Daniel Bodansky at the Arizona State University College of Law said transparency matters, and those progress reports are not simply taken on faith. \"The agreement provides for both expert and peer review of these reports,\" Bodansky said. Holding to international norms is a form of pressure, Bodansky argued. Zycher countered that China is autocratic and can ignore domestic and international pressure more easily than the United States, Canada and Europe. Gerrard said Scott\u2019s reference to China and India was misleading. \"It implies that China and India are subject to weaker requirements than the U.S.,\" Gerrard said. \"That is incorrect.\" The agreement\u2019s compliance rules might be weak, but they apply equally to all participating countries. The Biden administration will determine how ambitious the U.S. goals will be when it rejoins the agreement. At this point, we don\u2019t know what those will be. Gerrard and Bodansky both fault Scott for calling China and India the \"real polluters.\" The actual rankings are more complicated. As this chart shows, by one measure, China releases more carbon dioxide than the U.S. By another, the U.S. tops China. \"The United States is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, and has higher per capita emissions than either China or India,\" Bodansky said. \"It is misleading to point the finger at China and India and label them as the real polluters.\" By the yardstick of carbon dioxide releases relative to the size of the economy, the latest numbers come from 2016 World Bank data. China was at the top with 0.5 kilograms per dollar of GDP, with India and the U.S. tied at 0.3 kilograms per dollar of GDP. We reached out to Scott\u2019s office and did not hear back. Scott said the Paris Climate Agreement is bad for the United States because it fails to hold \"real polluters\" such as China and India accountable. People who study the agreement agree that it lacks teeth to hold each country to its carbon dioxide reduction goals. But its rules apply equally to all nations. China and India are treated the same as the U.S. China emits almost twice as much carbon dioxide as the U.S., but per person, the ranking is flipped, and the U.S. emits twice as much as China. By both standards, India emits much less than either country. The Paris agreement lacks strict enforcement, but Scott\u2019s comparisons to China and India are misleading. We rate this claim Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"",
        "doc": "Gov. Tony Evers struck a somber tone with his State of the State address on Jan. 12, 2021, as he remembered the lives lost to COVID-19 and reflected on the myriad challenges of 2020. But he also used part of his speech to touch on some of the state\u2019s accomplishments before the pandemic killed thousands and forced many Wisconsin residents into unemployment. Among them: Boosting funding for public schools. \"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade,\" Evers said. Is Evers on the money? Let\u2019s dig in. When asked for evidence to support the governor\u2019s claim, spokeswoman Britt Cudaback cited breakdowns by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau that detail the changes to general school funding, or equalization aids, in each budget dating back to 2005-2007. (Reminder: Wisconsin operates on a two-year budget cycle.) General aid is the primary pot of money for school districts, separate from categorical spending for specific needs such as transportation or meals. To assess changes over time, the Fiscal Bureau compares funding in the current budget to the second year of the previous budget \u2014 also known as the base year. According to an analysis of the 2019-2021 budget, that spending plan allocated an additional $329,942,000 \u2014 a 3.5% increase \u2014 for general school aid when compared to 2018-2019. So Evers had roughly the right number in his State of the State address. But was that the biggest hike in more than a decade? Here are the changes in school spending over the past 16 years as documented by the Fiscal Bureau: 2019-2021: increase of $329,942,000 (3.5%) 2017-2019: increase of $72,750,000 (0.8%) 2015-2017: increase of $108,137,500 (1.2%) 2013-2015: increase of $170,239,100 (2%) 2011-2013: decrease of $749,388,000 (8.1%) 2009-2011: decrease of $294,003,800 (3.1%) 2007-2009: increase of $76,756,000 (0.8%) 2005-2007: increase of $701,600,000 (8.1%) Evers is correct on that front, too. The 3.5% boost for 2019-2021 is easily the largest since the 2005-2007 budget, even when accounting for inflation. In his State of the State address, Evers said \"we put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\" The 2019-2021 budget increased general aid by 3.5% when compared to the previous year. That\u2019s the biggest hike for that pot of money since the 2005-2007 budget. We rate this claim True. ",

        "claim": "Says the number of spoiled coronavirus vaccines in North Carolina is \u201cvery small ... in the tens.\u201d",
        "doc": "With North Carolina initially among the slower states to administer coronavirus vaccines, reporters are raising questions about the effectiveness of its rollout. In a press conference on Jan. 21, a reporter asked Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen how many shots had been misused or gone to waste. \"We as a state don\u2019t want to waste any vaccine. We are seeing very small numbers of vaccine waste recorded in our CVMS system, but it\u2019s very few, like in the tens of doses,\" Cohen responded. Is North Carolina\u2019s spoil number \"very small,\" even \"in the tens?\" The state health department says, on average, it\u2019s receiving reports of fewer than 10 spoiled doses per provider. However, the total number of spoiled doses is in the four digits, not two. A day after Cohen\u2019s briefing, North Carolina\u2019s health department told the Associated Press that a total of 1,280 doses had been discarded. We asked the department about the comments Cohen made on Thursday. Was she describing the 1,280 number? Had she seen that specific 1,280 figure? Chris Mackey, the department\u2019s director of communications, said no. Cohen hadn\u2019t seen the specific total when she spoke at that Jan. 21 briefing, Mackey said, because the department didn\u2019t run a report on the numbers until later. Cohen based her comments on \"one-off conversations\" with other health officials. \"We ran a report when someone asked us for it. Mandy didn\u2019t have the number,\" Mackey said in a phone interview. \"She was trying to say we haven\u2019t seen any big incidents of vaccine waste.\" The 1,280 spoiled doses account for 0.1% of the 1.1 million doses in the state, the department said in an email. There are 250 healthcare providers administering the shots, the email said, meaning the losses average out to about five doses per provider. It\u2019s difficult to know how North Carolina\u2019s numbers compare with other states. The CDC has instructed states to report vaccine waste into its tracking system, agency spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund told PolitiFact. However, ProPublica reporters found that some states aren\u2019t tracking their spoiled doses. \"We are working to figure out how to provide this data online in the future when the data is more complete,\" Nordlund said. A 2019 report from the World Health Organization says vaccine waste is expected to be anywhere between 5% and 20% during mass vaccination campaigns. There are reports of other states losing hundreds of doses in single incidents. Wisconsin received national attention when authorities charged a local pharmacist with deliberately destroying around 500 doses of the vaccine. In Massachusetts, NBC News reported that a Veterans Affairs hospital lost 1,900 doses after a cleaning contractor accidentally unplugged a refrigerator. In Ohio, the Columbus Dispatch reported, a pharmacy spoiled 890 doses by failing to keep them properly stored. In another case, nearly 12,000 doses spoiled on the way to Michigan after the shipping truck got too cold. Cohen said the health department is receiving reports of \"very small numbers of vaccine waste \u2026 but it\u2019s very few, like in the tens of doses.\" The health department provided clarity on Cohen\u2019s remarks a day later. It\u2019s fair to say the rate of vaccine spoilage is \"very small\" \u2014 a tenth of 1%. However, it was inaccurate for Cohen to say the number was \"in the tens.\" The total number was 1,280.

        "claim": "Says Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d",
        "doc": "Sen. Marco Rubio, R. Fla., claimed that President Joe Biden talks like a centrist, but is \"governing like someone from the far-left.\" \"He has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone,\" Rubio said in a video. Is that true? Rubio tweeted the video shortly before 8 a.m. Jan. 22, so we evaluated Rubio\u2019s claim based on actions Biden had taken up to that point (Jan. 20-21). Setting aside the political implications of the word \"fiat,\" we found that available evidence supports Rubio\u2019s assessment: Biden\u2019s use of the executive power in his first two days far outpaced that of his predecessors. Rubio\u2019s office did not respond to our requests for information. The total number of presidential directives signed by Biden during his first two days in office is greater than the number signed by Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama over the same period. Biden issued 17 executive orders on his first two days in office, compared with Trump who issued one and Obama who issued two. Biden issued three proclamations, while Trump and Obama each issued one. Executive orders state how to manage the operations of the executive branch of the federal government. Proclamations communicate information on holidays, commemorations, special observances, trade, and policy. The Office of the Federal Register numbers each executive order and proclamation consecutively as part of a series and publishes them in the daily Federal Register after the White House sends over the information. Other presidential documents, such as memoranda and notices, are not numbered but are also published. The Office of the Federal Register is in the process of digitizing documents published prior to 1994. So we were unable to use that source to compare Biden\u2019s actions with all other presidents. We turned instead to the American Presidency Project, a nonpartisan source of presidential documents hosted at the University of California, Santa Barbara. If Rubio was referring to a president\u2019s first two days in office (instead of any two-day period), the available documents show that he is correct dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose first inauguration was in 1933, said Gerhard Peters, a political science professor at Citrus College and co-director of the American Presidency Project. The available record before FDR isn\u2019t complete enough to say definitively whether Rubio is also right about earlier presidents, but experts said it\u2019s likely that his claim still holds. \"Before FDR, presidents simply did not charge into office as prepared for action,\" said John Woolley, co-director of American Presidency Project and professor emeritus of political science at UCSB. \"Even Lincoln, judging by the record assembled by (his secretaries John G. Nicolay and John Hay), did not fire off as many orders as Biden despite there already being an active revolt in progress.\" Rubio used the word \"fiat\" \u2014 a politicized term that would suggest Biden rushed in sweeping and long-lasting policy changes. However, Biden in his first two days issued 10 executive orders and one memorandum to address a specific issue that\u2019s actively affecting the entire nation: the coronavirus pandemic. Biden was sworn into office around the time the United States recorded about 400,000 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Here\u2019s a rundown of those specific actions: Executive order mandating use of masks on federal property Executive order creating the position of COVID-19 response coordinator Executive order requiring masks in all forms of public transportation Executive order to develop and expand access to COVID-19 treatments Executive order to improve the collection and sharing of COVID-19 data Executive order to secure supplies necessary for responding to the pandemic Executive order to ensure equitable pandemic response and recovery Executive order to support the reopening and continuing operation of schools Executive order to protect workers from COVID-19 under the Occupational Safety and Health Act Executive order establishing the COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board Memorandum extending federal support to governors\u2019 use of the National Guard in their COVID-19 response \"No one would doubt the need for executive action to deal with an overwhelming health crisis, so this crisis situation makes this a unique point in time,\" said John Frendreis, a professor emeritus of political science at Loyola University Chicago. \"Rubio\u2019s comment is technically correct, although when taken together with the context, it is exaggerated.\" Besides those COVID-19 measures, Biden\u2019s actions included an order requiring an ethics pledge from his appointees and directives revoking several of Trump\u2019s policies. It\u2019s become more common for presidents to issue executive actions and for the other party to dislike it, said Daniel Gitterman, a public policy professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"When it\u2019s the president of the opposite party, they call it executive fiat, and when it\u2019s the president of the same party, they call it bold action,\" Gitterman said. According to the Federal Register, Trump signed 220 executive orders during his four years in office. Throughout their eight-year administrations, Obama signed 276 executive orders and George W. Bush signed 291. Rubio said Biden \"has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\" Fiats\" is a politically loaded term and ignores that many of Biden\u2019s directives were specific to the ongoing pandemic. Still, the available evidence on the number of directives issued supports Rubio\u2019s claim. We rate it True. RELATED: Which campaign promises did Joe Biden tackle first?

        "claim": "\"The process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not really exist when we came into the White House.\"",
        "doc": "President Joe Biden\u2019s chief of staff Ron Klain criticized the Trump administration\u2019s vaccination campaign as \"chaotic,\" adding Biden will work more closely with states to get vaccines into arms. On Meet the Press, Chuck Todd asked Klain about conflicting comments by Biden officials about whether the new administration had to create a vaccination distribution plan from scratch. Klain said Biden was building on progress from the initial wave of vaccinations, \"no question about it.\" \"But the process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole did not really exist when we came into the White House,\" Klain said. Really? We found that\u2019s taking things too far. Many experts said that the Trump administration\u2019s plan had some key holes, including a failure to communicate with the states and cities about the rollout and inadequate funding for vaccine distribution. But it did have a plan: rely on the states. \"The federal plan, much like the rest of the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, was very hands off when it comes to details of implementing public health interventions,\" said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"The last mile of vaccine delivery was not a big part of the federal plan by design.\" We asked Michael R. Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, if the Trump administration had a plan for vaccine distribution. \"It is all in what you mean by \u2018plan,\" Fraser said. \"If you mean a tactical guidebook on how to do vaccination from A to Z, no, there is no federal plan.\" Prakash Nagarkatti, vice president for research at the University of South Carolina, told USA Today that \"there was total lack of planning at the state level for mass vaccination, and the federal government did not help the states overcome the hurdles.\" In September, the Trump administration announced a general strategy to distribute the vaccine which included deliveries to states and, later, pharmacy chains. A partnership with CVS and Walgreens administered vaccines in some long-term care facilities. The closest thing to a federal plan was the playbook the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave states to help them create their own distribution plans. States wrote broad plans and submitted them in October. They lacked important details , such as how many doses they would get and when. (At the time, no vaccines were approved.) Without dollars to make them happen, state plans were essentially wish lists, Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, said on a podcast. It wasn\u2019t until December that Congress approved a COVID-19 package with $8 billion for vaccine distribution. At the same time, it\u2019s clear there was some level of coordination. The U.S. would not have been able to give shots to millions of people, enroll tens of thousands of private providers, and set up a data collection system tying in all 50 states if the federal and state governments had done no planning. \"To say there wasn\u2019t planning is not accurate,\" Hannan told PolitiFact. \"However, I don\u2019t think there was communication from the federal government about the plan, about the vision, about how things would work.\" A couple of days after Klain\u2019s interview, Biden offered a softened take on the work of the Trump administration. \"We want to give credit to everyone involved in this vaccine effort and the prior administration and the science community and the medical sphere \u2026 for getting the program off the ground,\" Biden said Jan. 26. \"And that credit is absolutely due.\" But Biden said that once he took office, he found that the vaccine program was in worse shape than he expected. The Biden administration has envisioned a more prominent federal role, including setting up 100 vaccine centers across the nation by the end of February. Officials say the biggest roadblock is lack of vaccine supply. Biden announced that his administration aims to purchase enough doses to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer or beginning of the fall. While the philosophical approach to federal involvement is different, \"you can\u2019t say absence of plan when the plan isn't the one you would have created,\" said KFF\u2019s Michaud. The Washington Post reported that Biden\u2019s advisers inherited something \"more like a black box than a bare cupboard \u2014 the result of fractured communication among federal, state and local officials and a juggling act between manufacturers making a new product and thousands of providers, from big hospital systems to tiny clinics, struggling to plan around an unknown amount of vaccine.\" As of Jan. 26, about 20 million people had received their first dose and about 3.5 million had received a second dose, according to the CDC. About 44 million doses had been distributed. The main challenge that states now face is they only know how many doses they are getting a few days in advance. Most state officials have said they could deliver double or triple the number of shots if they had a larger supply. \"The story here is the supply, not needing a plan,\" Fraser said. Klain said, \"The process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not really exist when we came into the White House.\" Klain was focusing his criticism on the phase of getting vaccinations into the arms of the general public, not the initial phase of vaccinating health care workers and workers and residents of long-term care facilities. The Trump administration\u2019s approach to distributing the vaccine was to give it to locations chosen by the states and to let them take it from there. There are many criticisms of this process, including that it took too long to give states money to implement their plans and a lack of communication from the top about how the rollout would work. But that was the plan they drew up. Saying there a plan \"does not really exist\" is beyond saying a plan is lacking. We rate Klain\u2019s claim Mostly False. CORRECTION, Jan. 28: We corrected the number of Americans the Biden administration hopes to fully vaccinate by the end of summer or early fall.",

        "claim": "Says Joe Biden is \u201cfollowing through with a fracking ban.\u201d",
        "doc": "An old campaign attack continues to dog President Joe Biden. A Jan. 25 post on Facebook juxtaposes two news articles: one from the Washington Post and one from Townhall, a conservative news site. The former article says Biden won\u2019t ban fracking, while the latter says he \"followed through\" with a ban. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Throughout the 2020 presidential election, we fact-checked many claims that Biden would ban fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from the ground. Several of them misrepresented his position, so we wanted to take a closer look at this post. (Screenshot from Facebook) We found that it, too, distorts Biden\u2019s actions by making them appear more sweeping than they really are. In short, Biden is doing what he said he would do if elected \u2014 that is, ban new fracking on federal land. On his first day, Biden signed an executive order that put a hold on all oil and gas development in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. On Jan. 27, he signed an additional executive order that pauses new oil and gas leases on federal land, effectively banning new fracking there for as long as the policy lasts. His moves leave current fracking untouched. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the Facebook post. The top of it shows the headline of a Washington Post fact-check published in early October. It debunked a Trump campaign ad that said, if elected president, Biden said he will end fracking. The headline: \"Trump campaign promotes false claim that Biden would end fracking.\" The second article in the Facebook post purportedly shows \"what Biden is doing,\" and was published by Town Hall on Jan. 20. Its headline said: \"Biden Administration: Yes, We Are Following Through With a Fracking Ban.\" The Townhall article covers an interaction at the first press briefing of the Biden administration. (The article more accurately explains the type of fracking that Biden promised to block.) On Jan. 20, White House press secretary Jen Psaki answered a reporter\u2019s question about the executive order that Biden signed that day about Alaska oil and gas drilling. Here\u2019s the exchange, in context: Reporter: \"President Biden promised to end all new oil and gas leasing on federal lands when he was a candidate. The order that you just mentioned that he signed today was much narrower than that \u2014it's a temporary moratorium and it only applies to (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). And there is some debate about whether he has the legal flexibility to even follow through with his full promise. Does the administration still have that commitment today? Psaki: \"We do, and the leases will be reviewed by our team. We just have only been in office for less than a day now\" What Biden signed was an executive order that paused the federal government\u2019s implementation of the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Trump-era program, passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, directed the Interior Department to issue leases for drilling oil and natural gas in the refuge\u2019s coastal plain. Biden\u2019s order also reinstated an Obama-era policy that withdrew certain areas of the Arctic from consideration for oil drilling. \"The Secretary (of the Interior) shall review the program and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts of the oil and gas program,\" Biden\u2019s executive order says. Biden\u2019s move tracked with his climate change plan, which calls for banning fracking on federal lands but not all fracking. RELATED:Biden Promise Tracker On Jan. 27 \u2014after the Facebook post and Townhall article were published \u2014Biden signed an additional executive order that directs the interior secretary to \"pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review.\" It would effectively prevent new fracking projects on federal land. The Interior Department said the order \"does not impact existing operations or permits for valid, existing leases, which are continuing to be reviewed and approved.\" Biden reiterated that point in remarks to the press. \"Let me be clear, and I know this always comes up: We're not going to ban fracking,\" he said. The Facebook post says Biden is \"following through with a fracking ban.\" That\u2019s not quite right. Biden has signed two executive orders related to land leases for oil and natural gas drilling. One order pauses new leases specifically in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while the other pauses new leases on all federal land. Neither ban existing fracking operations, and Biden has said repeatedly that he does not intend to do so. The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "doc": "During his first 48 hours in office, President Joe Biden signed a record number of executive orders and has continued issuing more, with many aimed at fighting the coronavirus pandemic or reversing orders issued by President Donald Trump. Did any of Biden\u2019s initial orders cost farmers a bushel full of cash by causing the price of corn and soybeans to plummet over 48 hours? That\u2019s the claim made in a widely shared Facebook post. The post is an image of a Jan. 23 tweet that was shared more than 30,000 times on Twitter and reads: \"Soybean price is down 70 cents per bushel in the last two days. Corn is down 50 cents per bushel in two days. For those who don\u2019t know, a small farmer like me working 1,000 acres just lost $100,000 on a 200 bushel per acre average corn crop thanks to Biden\u2019s executive orders.\" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There has been a sudden drop in these commodity prices, though arguably less than what the post claims. But experts PolitiFact spoke to said they saw no evidence that any of Biden\u2019s orders, which have the force of law, were the cause of the changes, given that prices have been running high. It\u2019s not clear which of Biden\u2019s early orders the post might be blaming. A Jan. 22 order asks the Department of Agriculture to consider expanding and extending federal nutrition assistance programs. Looking at changes between Jan. 20 \u2014 the date of Biden\u2019s inauguration and his first executive orders \u2014 to Jan. 23, the date of the tweet \u2014 soybean prices dropped 58 or 59 cents and corn prices 19 or 22 cents per bushel, depending on the contract, said Ben Brown, an agricultural and applied economics professor at the University of Missouri. Brown said the abrupt declines were not surprising, because prices have recently exceeded $13 per bushel for soybeans and $5 per bushel for corn, as crop supplies have been tight. \"Corn and soybean markets built strong gains in the markets over the last couple months with no major correction, leaving them vulnerable to last week\u2019s action,\" he said. \"I find no evidence to suggest that Biden\u2019s executive orders caused the dramatic decrease\" in prices, Brown said, noting that most of the orders \"were already known and any impact to commodity markets were built in.\" Looking at price changes another way \u2014 between Jan. 21 and 22, the two days after the first executive orders \u2014 the declines were 79 or 84 cents on soybeans, depending on the contract, and 26 to 28 cents on corn, said Aaron Smith, professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of Tennessee. \"Markets are simultaneously digesting data from multiple sources, so attributing declines or increases to one event over a three-day period should be done cautiously,\" Smith said. Because corn and soybean prices have been rising since August, driven by strong export sales, global weather concerns and other factors, \"a short-term correction and price consolidation was overdue,\" he said. Many factors led to the price declines during Biden\u2019s first days in office, Smith said, including beneficial rainfall and weather forecasts in South America; COVID-19 concerns related to new strains of the virus and a slower than expected pace of vaccinations; selling based on profit taking; and the change in the presidential administration. A widely shared Facebook post showing a picture of a tweet claimed that soybeans dropped 70 cents and corn 50 cents per bushel in two days, causing farmers to lose big money, \"thanks to Biden\u2019s executive orders.\" The prices of both commodities did drop significantly, though arguably less than the post claims, during Biden\u2019s first days in office. But two experts said they saw no evidence that any of the orders issued by Biden during those first days caused the price drops. The experts said the drops were not surprising, given that prices for both commodities had been running high, and that multiple factors were at play. We rate the post Mostly False.",

Bernie Sanders and New York Sen. Kristen Gillibrand. What America has Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more workers must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. There are a few exceptions. Eight states offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes: California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, Washington, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia. Some employers choose to provide paid maternity leave, but that touches only about 16% of private industry workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What other countries have The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development studied paid maternity leave for 36 OECD countries -- developed nations -- and five additional European Union countries and Costa Rica. On average across OECD countries in 2018, mothers were entitled to 51 weeks of paid leave after child birth. The United States was the only country in the study with no national law to provide that benefit. According to a 2014 report by the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, the United States and New Guinea were the only countries out of 170 that provided no cash benefits of any kind to women during maternity leave. Of 41 developed countries highlighted by the report, the U.S. also mandated the shortest period of time off \u2014 12 weeks. The 12-week law is still in effect. Back to Virginia Boysko\u2019s bill drew bipartisan opposition in the Senate committee and died on a 12-3 vote. Critics voiced concern that the wage tax was not clearly defined - the uncertain amount of the levy would be set after a determination of the revenues needed to support the leave program - and that the levy would impose financial hardships on small businesses and workers. The Senate, however, has expressed interest in taking a deeper look at the issue. It passed a bill instructing the State Corporation Commission to make recommendations this fall for establishing a plan that would encourage Virginia employers to voluntarily offer 12 weeks of paid family leave. The measure is pending in the House of Delegates. Jurisprudence PolitiFact National has given Mostly True ratings to statements of Obama in 2015 and Gillibrand in 2016 that the U.S. is the only industrialized nation that doesn\u2019t \"guarantee\" paid family leave. The slight flaw in their statements was that there were exclusions to the programs in some countries, so the benefit was not universal. In Canada, for example, temporary workers in 2016 couldn\u2019t get cash benefits. Canada also excluded migrant workers and people who owned more than 40% of their business. Norway and Switzerland excluded home workers. Boysko\u2019s statement is different. She does not say \"guarantee.\" She says the U.S. is the only industrialized nation that does not \"have a paid family medical leave program in place.\" All other industrialized nations do have family leave programs in place, although some of those plans do not \"guarantee\" all workers are covered. Our ruling Boysko said, \"The United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\" All other developed countries surveyed by the International Labor Organization have programs mandating at least some paid maternity leave. An international study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found the same thing. The benefit is not available to all workers in some countries, but Boysko doesn\u2019t claim that it is. So we rate her statement True. ",

        "claim": "\u201cThe U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President.\u201d",
        "doc": "Former President Donald Trump is staring down his second impeachment trial in as many years, but uncertainty looms over the unprecedented proceedings. That\u2019s because despite 245 years of history and 21 past impeachments by the U.S. House, the country has no direct precedent for an impeachment trial of a president who has left office. The House impeached Trump Jan. 13, 2021, for his role inciting the Capitol mob on Jan. 6. A trial is set to begin Feb. 8 in the U.S. Senate, but, of course, Trump has since departed the White House, having lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. The resulting procedural question has given rise to an array of claims about what exactly the U.S. Constitution says on the matter, including one from former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. \"The U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President,\" the longtime Republican politician said in a Facebook post Jan. 26. He then repeated the sentence nine more times for emphasis. Walker also repeated the claim on Twitter, truncated to four repetitions due to the 280-character limit. But if 2020 taught us anything, it\u2019s that saying something over and over on the internet doesn\u2019t make it true. So let\u2019s take a closer look. Despite the confident assertion from Walker \u2014 now president of Young America\u2019s Foundation, which seeks to introduce young people to conservative values \u2014 this is far from a settled topic. The core Constitutional section here is Article II, Section 4, which says, \"The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Article I specifies the two potential penalties in play are removal from office and disqualification from holding federal office in the future. Removal is obviously off the table at this point, but disqualification is a highly relevant consequence given Trump is said to be considering a 2024 run for president. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service dove deep into the precedent and constitutional interpretation in a Jan. 15 publication. They summarized their findings this way: \"The Constitution does not directly address whether Congress may impeach and try a former President for actions taken while in office,\" the six-page brief said. \"Though the text is open to debate, it appears that most scholars who closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.\" Some key points the publication lists in support of a trial for a former president: In 1876, the Senate ruled a former secretary of war could face an impeachment trial for actions taken in office even though he had since resigned (more on this in a bit). The U.S. impeachment process was set up with the British system in mind, where former officials could be impeached. The framers made many \"highly specific decisions about the impeachment process that departed from the British practice\" but \"chose not to explicitly rule out impeachment after an official leaves office.\" Many scholars have argued simple logic dictates impeachment remain an option. If impeachment didn\u2019t extend to someone no longer in office, any official could elude punishment by simply committing offenses late enough in the term, or by resigning once the impeachment process began. And Congress could never bar an official from holding future office as long as that person resigns first. In the only discussion of the timing of impeachment at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, most members took it for granted that the President would be impeachable after he left office. Former President John Quincy Adams clearly interpreted this as a non-expiring penalty. While serving as a Congressman after leaving the White House in 1846, he told Congress, \"I hold myself, so long as I have the breath of life in my body, amenable to impeachment by this House for everything I did during the time I held any public office.\" Key points against a trial for a former president The plain text of the Constitution, that \"[t]he President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment ... and Conviction,\" could be read literally as only applying to officials who are holding office during impeachment proceedings. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (1833) that impeachment doesn\u2019t apply to officials who have left their position because removal is no longer necessary. Supporting his claim, Walker leaned on the literal interpretation argument. \"The (constitutional) language does not refer to a former President,\" Walker said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"Furthermore \u2026 the language clearly defines the judgement as \u2018removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office\u2019 and it does not separate the two issues. The judgement is both, not either or.\" We\u2019ll note this and/or argument falls flat, however, as it flies in the face of history. The Senate has convicted and removed eight officials, but it chose to ban only three of them from holding future office. If the two were inextricably tied as Walker suggests, all eight would have been banned. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is among those who have leaned on the logic argument. \"It makes no sense whatsoever that a president or an official could commit a heinous crime against our country and then defeat Congress\u2019 impeachment powers \u2026 by simply resigning,\" Schumer, D-New York, said on the Senate floor on Jan. 26. Mitt Romney, the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump in his first impeachment, told CNN Jan. 24, \"I think it's pretty clear that the effort is constitutional\" based on legal opinions he has reviewed. That viewpoint conflicts with most other Republican senators. John Fortier, a specialist on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact National the problem is that \"the constitutional language is not specific either way.\" He noted Schumer and Republican Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, both cited constitutional passages in arguing the two sides. Historical precedent is of particular importance when the Constitution doesn\u2019t specify a course of action, and there is some in this case. The highest-profile suspension of an impeachment process involved President Richard Nixon. No Senate vote was taken because Nixon resigned after an impeachment vote from the House. The remaining possible penalty \u2014 a ban from holding federal office \u2014 didn\u2019t apply since Nixon had already served two terms, making any Senate action moot. That also makes the situation a poor analogue for the pending Trump impeachment. An 1876 case provides clearer parallels, however. William Belknap, secretary of war under President Ulysses S. Grant, was brought up for impeachment by the House, but he hastily resigned hours before the House voted to impeach him. When the matter moved to the Senate, Belknap argued the Senate had no jurisdiction since by the time the impeachment vote came up he \"was, (and) ever since hath been, and now is, a private citizen.\" The Senate disagreed. By a roll-call vote of 37-29, the Senate ruled Belknap was \"amenable to trial by impeachment for acts done as Secretary of War, notwithstanding his resignation of said office before he was impeached.\" In the end Belknap was acquitted, with 22 of the senators who supported acquittal saying they did so on the grounds that his resignation barred impeachment. So the Senate conclusion was not unanimous or unambiguous, but it was passed and supported by the majority of the body. Applying Belknap to the present situation, there\u2019s a case that the argument for trying Trump is even stronger than for Belknap, since Trump was impeached by the House while he was still in office, noted Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University, who wrote a 2001 paper on the subject. But there\u2019s an even simpler argument for this being constitutional: The current Senate said so. In a similar vote to that on Belknap\u2019s objection, the Senate on Jan. 26 voted 55-45 to table an objection from Paul that a trial of a private citizen violates the Constitution. Constitutional matters in this vein are traditionally left to the branches of government to interpret on their own, rather than relying on the courts, the Congressional Research Service says. It described the tradition this way: \"The Supreme Court has noted not only that \u2018each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution\u2019 when performing their \u2018assigned constitutional duties,\u2019 but also that once one branch develops a construction of its own powers, that interpretation \u2018is due great respect from the others.\u2019 This principle of developing constitutional meaning outside of the courts is especially applicable in the context of impeachment, where the manner by which the House and Senate exercise their powers has been largely immune from judicial review.\" Walker said on social media that \"The U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President.\" There is constitutional ambiguity on this point. That\u2019s something the Democrat-led Senate itself will decide as it steps into new historical territory considering the impeachment of a president after leaving office. But we know at this point in history it\u2019s an overreach to claim this is a settled matter, as Walker does here. If anything, the needle is pointing in the other direction based on the preponderance of legal opinion, Senate precedent and the Jan. 26 vote. We rate this claim Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\u201c84% of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this year is clean energy.\u201d",
        "doc": "In his rollout of major actions on climate change, President Joe Biden laid out his 2035 goal to see an electricity sector that puts zero carbon into the air. Biden emphasized that the change is underway. \"Already, 84% of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this year is clean energy,\" Biden said Jan. 27. \"Why? Because it\u2019s affordable; because it\u2019s clean; because, in many cases, it\u2019s cheaper.\" The part about 84% of new electricity capacity being clean energy stood out, and we dug into it. The latest government data backs him up. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the new electric capacity slated to come online in 2021, measured in total gigawatts, will be 39% solar, 31% wind, 11% from batteries, and 3% nuclear. That\u2019s where Biden got his 84%. Do those sources really amount to \"clean\" energy? There\u2019s a separate debate over nuclear power, because while it\u2019s carbon-free, there\u2019s the long term problem of nuclear waste. But that aside, there\u2019s also room to question the inclusion of battery power, as the federal government does. \"Batteries probably shouldn\u2019t be in the total,\" said energy economist Kenneth Gillingham with Yale University. \"They are not actually generating electricity. They are simply storing it for use at other times.\" Gillingham underscored that the link between batteries and renewables is strong, because batteries are vital to building the market for solar and wind power. But today, he said, batteries could well be charged with fossil-fuel powered electricity. Taking batteries out of the total, at least 70% of the new electric power capacity is carbon-free, which isn\u2019t too far from what Biden said. Still, while electricity from wind and solar has grown rapidly, it represents only about 10% of the national total. Fossil fuels power over 60% of the nation\u2019s electricity supply. A peek at the details of the latest government report shows a surge of new renewable power coming online in December 2021. The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said that\u2019s a result of federal investment tax credits. Those credits let facility owners deduct a percentage of the project cost from their taxes. Until Congress changed the law at the end of 2020, that particular financial incentive was due to drop from 22% in 2021 to 10% in 2022. With millions of dollars in play, companies didn\u2019t want to lose the 12-point difference and moved projects along as quickly as they could. The experts we reached said several factors led the country to see less new capacity fueled by natural gas, and more by renewables. On top of the tax credits, technology improvements, state and local level policies to boost renewable power and demand from utilities and industry combined to make renewables the leading option. The 2021 number is no outlier. There have been ups and downs, but over the past 10 years, renewables have averaged over 57% of new utility-scale electric capacity. Susan Tierney, senior adviser with the private consulting firm Analysis Group in Denver, said Biden\u2019s statistic shows progress on the climate change front, but it also underscores how much remains to be done. \"It is clear that there will need to be continued, and accelerated, additions of renewables, storage, and other zero-carbon technologies in upcoming years, in order to decarbonize the electric system,\" Tierney said. \"The 84% increase is just one more year\u2019s increment, and many multiples of that amount will be needed.\" Biden said that 84% of new electric capacity scheduled to come online in 2021 was from clean energy. The number is credible, but it includes 11% from battery storage. Batteries are essential to the expansion of wind and solar power, but they are not necessarily \"clean\" energy sources; they could be charged with electricity produced from fossil fuels. Taking batteries out of the equation still leaves a total of about 70% from wind and solar. However, renewables remain a lesser slice of electricity supply. About 60% of the nation\u2019s electric power comes from fossil fuels. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Says that Biden\u2019s ban on new federal leases will kill 120,000 Texas jobs.",
        "doc": "President Joe Bidenmade good onhispromise totake actiononcurbing U.S.emissionswhenheissued an executive orderhalting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and water. Theorder,signedWednesday,directs the Department of the Interior to pauseissuingleasesto oil and gas companiespending areviewof theclimateimpactsofthe department\u2019sleasing and permitting practices.About 22% of U.S. oil production is reliant on federal lands and waters. Anticipating Biden\u2019s move, U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas,expresseddismay at how amoratoriumon leasing would impact jobs in Texas\u2019 oil and gas sector. \"Killing more Texas jobs,\" Brady saidin aJan. 22tweet. \"After killing #KeystoneXL pipeline, #Biden suspends new oil/gas leasing on fed lands/water. If permanent, 120,000 TX jobs lost. 120,000 MORE jobless. Pssst... aren't you supposed to CREATE jobs?\" Biden\u2019s move will have a disproportionateeffect on states with large swaths of federal landsused for oil and gas activity.New Mexico, for instance, has 24 million acres of federal land, or about 32% of the state\u2019s total land mass; Wyoming has 29 million federally owned acres, or about 47% of the state. Texas, on the other hand, has verylittlefederally-ownedland\u20143 million acres, or2%of the state.Nearly half ofthatismanaged by the U.S. National Park Service.As of 2019, about 185,000 acres wereunderlease for oil and gasproductionin Texas. Although most of Texas\u2019 oil and gas industry is based onshore,a sliver of the industry is actively drillinginfederal waters in the Gulfof Mexico.As of Jan. 22, therewere 16 offshorerigs in the Gulf comparedwith175onTexasland, according to the Baker Hughes rigcount.(In February last year,before the coronavirus pandemic dealt major blows to theglobal oil industry, about 20 rigs were deployed in the Gulf compared to around 400 onshorein Texas.) With such a small fraction of the state\u2019s industrylikelyimpacted by Biden\u2019s directive, is Brady correct when he says that120,000Texasjobsare at stake? According to Brady\u2019s aides, the number hecited is pulled from a study releasedlast yearby the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade and lobbyist group.Thestudy estimated that a ban on new and existing leases would cost nearly1million jobsby 2022, with top production-states hit the hardest. While Texas would lose 120,000 jobs, New Mexico would lose62,000 and Wyomingwouldlose 33,000, the study says. But the Biden administration\u2019s moratorium on federal land leasing halts only new leasesfrom being issued. Brady\u2019s tweetmisses this distinction. Hesaid that the ban on new leasing would cost Texas 120,000 jobs, while the study he cited totaled losses tied tobanningboth new andexisting leases. The petroleum institute hasn\u2019t released estimates of how many jobs will be impacted by Biden\u2019sorder. Another group, theWyoming Energy Authority, released a study last month that determined a ban on new leasingalone would impact 58,700 jobs in the eight states that make up the majority of public landproduction, which does not include Texas. However, an American Petroleum Institutespokesperson said it's reasonable to expect the administrationwillexpand the ban to include existingleases as well. \"We view this as a first step toward a federal leasing ban that would impact all oil and gas development on federal lands and water,\" saidspokespersonBethanyAronhalt. This expectation is based on numerous remarksthe presidenthas made on the issue. For instance, during a 2020 primary debate, Bidensaid \"no more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period\u2014ends.\"AndAaronhalthighlighted how Biden's nominee forinteriorsecretary, environmentalist and progressive Deb Haaland of New Mexico,has been unequivocal inher opposition to leasing federal lands and watersto the industry. \"I am wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands,\" she toldThe Guardianin 2019. \"Public lands are a statement about who we are as Americans. The most pristine and beautiful places in our country should never belong to one person.\" If Biden did ban all federal leasing \u2014 new and existing, onshore and offshore \u2014does Texas stand to lose 120,000 jobs by 2022? \"Most of the Texas impact is due to closing development of the Gulf of Mexico, of the offshore\" drilling, saidGeoff Brand,Senior Economic Advisor at the American Petroleum Institute. Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico supports about 300,000 jobs, according to a Bureau of Ocean Energy Managementestimate.This figure represents both jobs createddirectlyby industry \u2014 like offshore drilling,platform construction and platform staffing \u2014 and the jobsindirectlycreated bythe industry, like service companies and other onshore support operations.Ineconomic terms, the 300,000 figure represents jobs created by the industry\u2019s direct, indirect and induced economic impacts. That workforce is sourced primarily from Texas andLouisiana, each of whichcontributeabout 150,000 workerstotheoffshoreindustry, Brand said.Theprojected 120,000 Texas jobs lost due to a possible ban onnew and existing federal leaseswould impactroughly 80% of Texas\u2019 offshore workforce. This figure is so high, Brand said,becausemost jobs are created when the industry spends capitalup-front ondrillingnew wellsandconstructing new platforms.A complete ban on new leasing or permits would grindthat development to a halt. \"If you stop drilling and expanding, then you\u2019re justmaintaining production platforms,\" Brand said. \"It's kind of like building a pipeline \u2014 you get most the jobs up front when you spend the capitol and build things. It\u2019s when you spend the money that the jobs are created....If you're maintaining a platform, you're spending some operational money, but you're not really spending that much.\" The American Petroleum Institute\u2019s study is based ontheNational Energy Modeling System,a model ofdomesticenergy marketscreatedby the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The model bases employment numbers on the industry\u2019s rate of spending. The harder it becomes for producers to obtain leases and permits, the less they\u2019re spending on development, which,as a result, sheds jobs. The methodology behind the institute\u2019s analysisis unobjectionable, according to Karr Ingham, a petroleum economist with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers. \"If that activity is just stopped wholesale, what do you think's going to happen to those jobs?\" he said. \"Even someone who's utterly opposed to energy production, offshore production, federal lands production, whatever the case may be, taking issue with the way they went about this (analysis) would be a difficult proposition. They started with a sound model and went through sound processes to end up with state-level impacts,\" Ingham said. Although the industry will adjust to Biden\u2019s directive by reallocating resources to drilling on non-federal lands and waters, those adjustmentswill begradualand may not impact short-term economic projections. Similarly, it willtake time forjobs in the fossil fuel industry to be replaced by jobscreatedin new energy sectors.The administration has stressed the importance ofgreenjob creationas it shrinks the fossil fuel sector.Biden\u2019s Build Back Better economic recovery plan pledges to\"create millions of good-paying union jobs\"bybuilding a \"clean energy economy.\" But Ingham says it will taketimebefore these new industries are replacing lost fossil fuel jobs on a one-to-one ratio. \"If a job gets lost some time in the next 12 months, what are you going to replace that job with? Where are those folks going to go\" Ingham said. \"It's not likeforevery job you eliminate in the oil and gas sector, a green energy job springs up on the otherside.\" Anticipating Biden\u2019s move to ban leasing on federal lands and waters, Brady said thata permanent ban on new leasing will cost Texas 120,000 jobs. Bradypulledthatnumberfroma report released last year by the American Petroleum Institute. However, the institute said that the 120,000 figureis based ona ban ofboth new and existing federal leases, which is more far-reaching than Biden\u2019s actions so far.Brady\u2019s commentignores that distinction. Otherwise, the 120,000joblossesprojected by the institute\u2019s analysis is accurate given that it was based onmodeling from the federal National Energy Modeling System.
